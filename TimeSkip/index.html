<p>An experiment gone wrong abord the Vulcan Science Directorate's T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory leads the <em>Endeavour</em> crew to a Vulcan/Andorian border system to render assistance. The Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal mechanics experiments, which results in the <em>Endeavour</em> bridge crew not only being thrown forward and backward within their timeline, but across multiple alternate realities as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their own demise.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of events out of order and across variations of parallel universes as a result of the strange radiation emanating from the crippled station resonating with the particles from an anti-radiation inoculation that only the player characters were able to receive <em>before</em> coming into range of the station. The effect cannot be reproduced, as once the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they will rapidly decompose.</p>
<p>The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to <em>leak</em> into each other, often with lethal consequences. The players will need to reverse the experiment at the core of the laboratory to restore the boundaries between universes.</p>

<p><em>Scene 0 (T + 0 Hours)</em></p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Captain's Log: Stardate 2156.7</p>
<p>The <em>Endeavour</em> is responding to an automated distress signal from the
Vulcan Science Directorate's T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory on the
Vulcan-Andorian border. With the Vulcan Space Agency fleet still recovering
from First Minister T'Pau's house-cleaning, Starfleet Command has ordered
us to lend whatever assistance the laboratory requires until a Vulcan aid
vessel can be dispatched. I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive
casualties, and our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control
teams should the station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any
further information from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for
any contingency.</p>
<p>Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from
the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the
readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer
could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the
<em>Endeavour</em>, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the
recent rumblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the
goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station; should my
decision prove unwise, this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown
nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all
potential away team members be inoculated against a wide range of
radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is
performing the injections now.</p>
<p>Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please
update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy.</p>
</div>

<p><em>Scene 5 (T + 8 Hours)</em></p>
<p>As the <em>Endeavour</em> prepares to drop out of warp, the crew feels a sudden lurch in their stomachs, as though the grav-plating has suddenly reversed polarity.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">The Shift</p>
<p>You feel a sudden lurch in your stomach, as though the grav-plating had
suddenly reversed polarity. Your hearing and vision are filled with a
maddening superposition of millions of ghostly echoes. It's as if someone
had overlaid a thousand takes of a movie scene, all carrying out the same
actions and speaking the same words, but each one just slightly out of sync
with the rest. As the specters dissipate away, you find yourself disoriented
and carrying a profound sense of estrangement.</p>
</div>
<p>The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the situation around the players has changed completely. Whereas the ship was previously operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves rocked and thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled ship. Tasks from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules.</p>
<p>All players should attempt a <strong>Fitness + Security Task</strong> with a Difficulty of 2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are knocked prone, and will need to perform the <em>Change Position</em> Minor Task before they can perform any ship-related Task.</p>
<p>A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours after the <em>Endeavour</em>'s arrival in the system. The main computer is severely damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship logs, are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading what has happened in those 8 hours. As the players look around the bridge, the sense of estrangement should only grow. Although this is clearly still the <em>Endeavour</em>, it is not <em>their Endeavour</em>. All of the Starfleet insignia are wrong, and the United Earth logos and inscriptions instead present themselves as the Earth Alliance.</p>
<p><img alt="Earth Alliance Seal" src="../img/Earth_Alliance_Seal.jpg" /></p>
<p>As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the doctor's inoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding themselves without any memories since dropping out of warp. As far as they are concerned the <em>Endeavour</em> was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain Winchester (NPC) was not among the inoculated, and orders all stations to provide a Damage Report unaware of what is going on with the players.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Status Report</p>
<p>What in the name of hell is going on here! This was supposed to be a rescue
operation, we're not equipped to take on that many ships, and certainly not
after getting caught with our proverbial pants down. We can't take much
more of this. Helm, do your best to make us as small a target as possible.
All stations, damage report!</p>
</div>
<p>Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a <strong>Control + Command</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the Damage Report. Any attempt to question the Captain or the rest of the crew is met by a sharp rebuke and a direct order you carry out instructions.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">This is not the Time...</p>
<p>Save the questions for if we get out of this mess. I gave you an order,
I expect you to carry it out or relieve yourself of duty! This is not
the time to dawdle, people!</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the players, the <em>Endeavour</em> is currently under attack from an Andorian fleet from an alternate reality where the United Coalition of Planets never formed as the Enterprise failed to prevent a war between Vulcan and Andoria. Severely outnumbered by two dozen <em>Kumari-Class</em> vessels, the <em>Endeavour</em> will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then.</p>
<p>The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">This is the Captain...</p>
<p><em>This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands
abandon ship!</em></p>
</div>
<p>Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods fail catastrophically and destroy the <em>Endeavour</em>. Just as the bridge fills with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point.</p>

<p><em>Scene 3 (T + 6 Hours)</em></p>
<p>The players find themselves in EV Suits deep within a breached section of the station. The corridors are pitch black, the only lights are those coming from the group's helmet torches. The artificial gravity in this section has failed, and the suit's HUD indicates there is no breathable atmosphere.</p>
<p>They are accompanied by a pair of figures in Vulcan-esque space suits, which bear the High Command's insignia. The EV suit HUD labels these figures as Subcommander V'Thena and Subaltern Skutt, both members of the Vulcan Security Forces, the V'Shar.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">T'Var's Warning</p>
<p>You should be approaching the air-gap now. The turbolifts are down, so you
will need to descend carefully. Fortunately the security system is
unpowered, otherwise your traversal would be significantly more difficult.
Once you are inside the station core, you will need to reroute power to the
station's communication channels, otherwise I will be unable to guide you
further as the chamber is hardened against interference.</p>
</div>
<p>If the players have questions for Subcommander V'Thena, they will find her quite dry and uninterested in conversation. The key detail they should gain is that the attack was sudden, unexpected, and unmotivated. Neither V'Thena nor the players know at this time that the Andorians attacking the station were uncontrolled leaks from another alternate reality. There is evidence, ranging from the strange uniforms and insignia, and data padds with references to the Andorian People's Army, presumably an unknown splinter faction with surprising organization, in reality an alternate reality faction at war with Vulcan.</p>
<details class="info"><summary>What the Subcommander Knows</summary><ul>
<li>Where are we?  <ul>
<li>Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are we here?  <ul>
<li>The <em>Endeavour</em> is responding to a distress signal from the
Laboratory, which suddenly came under attack by the Andorian Empire. Though
ostensibly neutral, Starfleet has de-facto sided with the High Command.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are we in this hallway?<ul>
<li>The experiment running in the station's core must be shut down. T'Var
has determined that the experiment is causing spatio-temporal anomalies
that threaten any vessel in the area.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the rest of the station's personnel?  <ul>
<li>V'Thena does not want to speculate without additional information. All
she knows is that there are pockets of survivors throughout the crippled
station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened?  <ul>
<li>An unknown group of Andorians attempted to take the station, but failing
that resorted to attempting to destroy it. They have been repelled, but
the damage is extensive. Most strangely, the Andorian attackers were not
wearing typical Imperial Guard uniforms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened moments earlier?<ul>
<li>A half dozen Andorian soldiers attempted to take the principal scientists
hostage, but was repelled thanks to the players' assistance. Their bodies
were searched and revealed they must have been from a splinter faction,
though an incredibly organized one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the station's current status?<ul>
<li>Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the <em>Endeavour</em>?  <ul>
<li>Currently chasing down the unknown Andorian vessels that attacked the
station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are the Andorians attacking?<ul>
<li>No idea, the laboratory isn't remotely worth a shooting war with the
High Command and the Empire.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why isn't the Coalition stopping them?<ul>
<li>What Coalition. If you're referring to the Treaty of Galorndorn Core,
everyone knows that the recent alliance between the High Command and
the Romulan Star Empire has put the Andorians on edge, but this is an
entirely illogical target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the history between Starfleet and the Vulcans/Romulans?  <ul>
<li>Earth was a Vulcan protectorate until the Vulcan-Romulus treaty two
years ago, whch elevated it to an independent stellar nation in gratitude
for normalizing relations between the two empires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have the scientists been working on?<ul>
<li>That information is beyond the Subcommander's clearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with a
stern disapproval of humans asking illogical questions.</p>
</details>
<p>As T'Var stated, the group quickly reaches a sealed airlock, which will require a <strong>Fitness + Security</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 3 to open. Alternatively, a <strong>Control + Engineering</strong> Task with the same difficulty can be attempted to jury-rig the airlock mechanism. Either task may Succeed at a Cost, which will take significantly more time and result in the security system's power being restored before the group can access the air-gap.</p>
<p>The air-gap, as the name implies, is a pair of concenctric spheres with an evacuated gap in between. The only things connecting the inner shell to the outer one are a series of massive docking clamps, which engaged automatically when the station lost power. Normally the core is entirely disconnected from the rest of the station, and held in place with highly calibrated tractor beams.</p>
<p>Travel between the two sides is limited to a pair of free-floating pods that ride along their own tractor beams, but the damage to the station knocked them loose from the moorings. They are currently free-floating within the gap.</p>
<p>At some point during the traversal (or as the airlock is being opened if the players took too long), one of the other groups of survivors restores power to this section of the station, not knowing there was anyone inside. The security system activates, and a group of fixed phaser turrets begin to take aim at the group. With internal sensors down and the station ostensibly under attack, the security system has mistaken the group for saboteurs.</p>

<p>The free-floating pods can be used to provide heavy cover (4 Cover Dice), but they require a <strong>Daring + Conn</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 3 to move using the EV jetsuits, and has a complication range of 18-20.</p>
<p>The inner airlock must also be bypassed or forced open. If the turrets are still firing, the Task has a Difficulty of 4. Once inside the airlock however, the group will be safe from the turrets, only to be flung once again through time.</p>

<p><em>Scene 1 (T + 1 Hours)</em></p>
<p>The <em>Endeavour</em> drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have expected before being catapulted into the <em>Endeavour</em>'s destruction. Once again however, there are subtle differences to everything, notably the governmental insignia, which reference EarthGov and EarthDome in place of UnitedEarth and Starfleet, respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="EarthDome" src="../img/Earthdome_wiki.webp" /></p>
<p>Additionally, it appears that all the rank insignia and titles are based on the army rather than the navy.</p>

<p>The ship's logs are accessible, but with all the activity on the bridge there isn't much time to pore over every detail. As historical research is not typically part of bridge duty, access to the historical records is comparatively time consuming, and excessive requests will be noticed and reported to the Captain, who will humor a question or two but instruct the players to focus on the mission at hand. In any event the Captain will almost immediately begin issuing orders, leaving only a little bit of time for research.</p>
<details class="quote"><summary>Colonel Winchester's Log: August 2161</summary><p>The <em>Endeavour</em> is responding to an automated distress signal from the
Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory on the Andorian Badlands
border. With the Self-Defense Forces fleet still recovering from the recent
Klingon incursions, EarthDome has ordered us to lend whatever assistance
the laboratory requires until an Andorian aid vessel can be dispatched. I
have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and our Chief
Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the station's
structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information from
the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency.</p>
<p>Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from
the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the
readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer
could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the
<em>Endeavour</em>, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the
recent rumblings along the Klingon border, EarthDome could use all the
goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my
decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown
nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all
potential away team members be inoculated against a wide range of
radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is
performing the injections now.</p>
<p>Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please
update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy.</p>

<details class="info"><summary>What the Endeavour's Log Shows</summary><ul>
<li>Where are we?  <ul>
<li>Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are we here?  <ul>
<li>The <em>Endeavour</em> is responding to a distress signal from the
Laboratory.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Has there been communication with the station?<ul>
<li>No. Only the automated distress signal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened earlier?<ul>
<li>EarthDome issued orders to the <em>Endeavour</em> to immediately detour
from it's patrol route and render assistance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the station's current status?<ul>
<li>Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where are the attackers?  <ul>
<li>Unknown, it's possible they got what they wanted and left, or they
could be hiding nearby, ready to spring a trap. Early sensor readings
indicate the weapons were Vulcan.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are the Vulcans attacking?<ul>
<li>Tensions between warring Vulcan factions and their former subjugate
nations are at an all-time high. After the implosion of the Vulcan government
and the subsequent breakup of their hegemony five years ago, some factions
are trying to carve out a piece of the carcass for themselves. Presumably
some new faction has sprung up and decided to attack a soft target.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why is the <em>Endeavour</em> helping?<ul>
<li>EarthDome considers improving relations with the Andorian Free State
of paramount importance to planetary security.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the history between EarthGov and the Vulcans/Andorians?  <ul>
<li>As a minor, mostly autonomous protectorate not deemed particularly
important, EarthGov weathered the collapse of the hegemony with only
minor changes, but is in desperate need of allies against an upstart race,
known as the Klingons, that were previously kept in check by the Vulcans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have the station been working on?<ul>
<li>That information is not available.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, more detailed questions will simply return a warning that EarthGov
resources are not to be utilized for personal projects.</p>
</details>
<p>A scan of the station requires a <strong>Reason + Science</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Science</strong> with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been activated.</p>
<p>A <strong>Control + Engineering</strong> Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes.</p>
<p>The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should the <em>Endeavour</em> strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players may attempt a <strong>Reason + Science</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Science</strong> with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once detected, the anomalies can be <em>Charted</em> using a <strong>Reason + Conn</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Conn</strong> with a Difficulty of 3. A successful Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 <strong>Daring + Conn</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Engines + Conn</strong>.</p>
<p>A closer study of the anomalies with a <strong>Reason + Science</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Science</strong> with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the experiment by 2.</p>
<p>Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the station, they will be reminded that EarthGov owes the Andorian Free State a great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet has issued specific instructions that the <em>Endeavour</em> is to render any and all assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders. Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be dispatched aboard shuttlepods.</p>
<p>Once the <em>Endeavour</em> has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.</p>

<p><em>Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours)</em></p>
<p>The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station, surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship communications are being jammed.</p>
<p><img alt="Romulan Republic" src="../img/Romulan_Republic_Emblem.png" /></p>
<p>Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces are written in an unknown script. An <strong>Insight + Command</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as an offshoot of ancient Vulcan.</p>

<p>One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking them to be a human peculiarity.</p>
<p>A closer inspection of their faces reveals that she looks almost identical to Subcommander V'Thena and one of the Romulan guards, Enuhlan Vrolmut, resembles Subaltern Skutt. Unlike their Vulcan doppelgangers, these Romulans are charismatic and jovial, and seem quite friendly.</p>
<p>This scene should roughly match the information gathered during the descent to the laboratory core. An unknown group of combatants appeared out of nowhere, attacked without warning or cause, and left a swath of destruction before being defeated, only to have a new mystery as the attackers' faction does not match any known entity. This time however, it is Klingons who have crossed over and attacked the station, which is especially troubling for the natives of this reality as the Klingons have never been this ferocious, they tend to prefer a good deal of subterfuge and covert ops.</p>
<details class="info"><summary>What the Centurion Knows</summary><ul>
<li>Where are we?  <ul>
<li>Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are we here?  <ul>
<li>The laboratory came under sudden attack by unknown Klingon forces.
Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the
<em>Endeavour</em> responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can
be dispatched.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are we in this hallway?<ul>
<li>The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the
Klingon boarding party is dealt with.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the rest of the station's personnel?  <ul>
<li>Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal
scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell.  </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened earlier?  <ul>
<li>A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport
to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched,
but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What happened moments earlier?<ul>
<li>The scientists were 'escorted' into the shelter and defensive positions
were setup.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the station's current status?<ul>
<li>Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where is the <em>Endeavour</em>?  <ul>
<li>Currently chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the
assault team from being retrieved.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why are the Klingons attacking?<ul>
<li>Unclear, the Klingons have never been particularly aggressive, this
must be some kind of violent splinter group looking to make a quick buck.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Where are the Vulcans?<ul>
<li>Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have
basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that
Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied?  <ul>
<li>Officially, 2 years, ever since the <em>Enterprise</em> came to the Republic's
aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given
the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How many Klingons do we expect?<ul>
<li>No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be
all that survived in this section of the station.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What have the scientists been working on?<ul>
<li>No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some
quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier.</p>
</details>
<p>None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers approach. The Romulans will voice their confusion at the strange attire and odd choice of weapons, which to the players should seem typically Klingon.</p>

<p>Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one.</p>
<p>If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As before, the insignia and equipment doesn't appear to be recognized by the Romulans, who have never heard of the Klingon Empire. They're familiar with the Klingon Consortium, but this could represent a drastic shift in culture, or some long-lost warrior splinter faction.</p>

<details class="info"><summary>Tolvar's Worries</summary><p>Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been poring through
the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that
the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between
realities.</p>
<p>Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that
the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a  <strong>Reason + Science</strong> Task
with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. If the Task is failed or
not attempted, Tolvar will spend additional time explaining the data,
reducing the time available for additional questions. In any
event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of
Tolvar's analysis.</p>
<p>If the players successfully follow Tolvar's explanation, they will gain an
important insight into the experiment still underway deep within the
station's core, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated
with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of
time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform
the Tasks.</p>
<p>If the players reveal that they are from an alternate reality, they will
discover that Tolvar is one of the only characters that will take them
seriously. He will excitedly ask about the players' reality, but won't get
too far in his questioning before Lithena interrupts.</p>
</details>
<p>A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core.</p>
<p>In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber.</p>

<p><em>Scene 4 (T + 7 Hours)</em></p>
<p>The players are inside the central core of the station, still in EV suits though there are emergency lights available. The artificial gravity is weak but functional.</p>
<p>Unlike other realities, the players are utterly alone in this iteration. It appears that the station's crew has been killed recently. The corpses of various species can be found strewn around, apparently suffocated as the station's life support failed. A mixed complement of Vulcanoids and Andorians can be found, but their insignia are not recognized. An <strong>Insight + Medicine</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the Vulcanoids fall somewhere between a Vulcan and a Romulan. A Momentum spend further reveals that the two races must have recombined at some point in the past 700 years.</p>
<p>Communications with the <em>Endeavour</em> are not available, as the core is heavily shielded against interference. A review of the station's log shows that most entries are irreversibly encrypted, and the controls have all been locked out.</p>
<p>The experiment involves a massive particle accelerator, which must be properly quenched to prevent an explosion that could destroy the station. This is a Gated Challenge that requires multiple characters to perform a set of actions. If the group succeeded in following Tolvar's explanation, the Difficulty of these Tasks is reduced by 2. Similarly, if the players previously gathered detailed information about the anomalies, the complication range of these checks is reduced by two.</p>

<p>A complication in an earlier task affects the next in sequence, increasing the Difficulty of that Task by 1 for each complication incurred.</p>
<p>All of the tasks can Succeed at a Cost, though the mounting complications mean that the station's systems suffer damage in the process. If the final <em>Quench</em> operation is not successful, the experiment still shuts down, but a power overload in the station's reactors quickly builds. The effect is irreversible, and the station will be destroyed. Regardless of the outcome, just as the final exotic particles are annihilated, a surge of radiation kicks the players forward in time.</p>

<p><em>Finale (T + 10 Hours)</em></p>
<p>The players find themselves aboard the bridge of the <em>Endeavour</em>. Depending on the outcome of the previous scene, the atmosphere can be drastically different. Fortunately for the players, it appears they are back in <em>their Endeavour</em> at last.</p>
<p><img alt="UESPA" src="../img/UESPA.png" /></p>
<p><em>Experiment Successfully Reversed</em></p>
<p>If the players successfully reverse the effects of the experiment, they find the bridge filled with members of the Vulcan science and security teams that survived and are helping the <em>Endeavour</em> crew supervise further rescue and repair operations.</p>
<p>The tactical officer will note that a fleet of Andorian ships has arrived. They hail the <em>Endeavour</em>, and offer their assistance with the rescue effort. Despite the decades of animosity between the two nations, the Andorians seem earnest in their offer. The ranking Vulcan officer graciously accepts the Andorians' help, and makes a point of stating that such a scenario would have been unthinkable without humanity's intervention to create the Coalition.</p>
<p><em>Laboratory Destroyed</em></p>
<p>If the attempt at halting the experiment resulted in failure, the station's reactors are on the verge of detonation. The bridge is clear, save for perhaps one or two scientists that survived the ordeal, including Doctor Stolvar. They lament the loss of the station, and watch stoicly as the station's reactors explode, tearing the station apart.</p>
<p>Long range sensors pick up an Andorian fleet just as it opens a hail. The Andorian commander expresses regret that the Vulcans did not heed their repeated warnings to increase security measures throughout the sector. He adds that the Andorian delegation to the Coalition will be presenting this incident as evidence that the Vulcan High Council is woefully unprepared to take over the running of the Vulcan government. Regardless, he offers to assist in the salvage efforts in hopes that at least some of the station's personnel can have an honorable burial.</p>
<p><em>In Either Event</em></p>
<p>A review of the ship's database reveals that everything is as it should be. The player's actions across the various leaked realities appear to have been mirrored here, though rather than fighting a Klingon or Andorian complement it was a group of Orion pirates hoping to make off with secret military technology.</p>
<p>Should the players decide to reveal the particulars of their experience hopping between realities, one of the nearby Vulcan scientists, Doctor Stolvar, will engage in conversation. The scientist admits that there was data that could not be directly explained, but the Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that any kind of travel between alternative realities is impossible. A <strong>Reason + Medicine</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that it was the doctor's inoculation, coupled with a fresh exposure to the strange radiation from the still-running experiment caused the players to experience these 'reality shifts'. Doctor Stolvar however suggests that it is more likely that the away team simply suffered hallucinations as a result of the exposure.</p>
