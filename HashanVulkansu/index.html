<p>The <em>Vaankara</em>, Vulcan spaceship long-thought lost to the Delphic Expanse re-appears on long-range sensors traveling at high warp towards a Romulan colony. All attempts to contact the vessel have failed, though that is to be expected as the Vulcan High Command had received a transmission from the <em>Vaankara</em> showing the crew killing each other violently as a result of Trellium-D induced psychosis. The ship is travelling slightly too fast for the Endeavour's Warp Five engine to keep up with, but it should be possible to match velocities just long enough for a small away team to transport aboard and shut down the <em>Vaankara</em>'s warp engines before it crosses into Romulan territory.</p>
<div class="admonition info">
<p class="admonition-title">GM Guidance</p>
<p>Note that this mission is very open ended in terms of player sequence. Part
of the experience will be an exploration of the <em>Vaankara</em>, and as a result,
the exact sequence of visited locations is not necessarily fixed. GMs are
encouraged to use the provided <a href="#appendix-a-compartment-complication-tables">tables of Compartment
Hazards</a> to generate interesting
rooms.</p>
<p>If a more linear experience is desired, particularly for simplicity, the
players could be provided with additional information about the state of the
<em>Vaankara</em> ahead of time. For example, the early scans of the <em>Vaankara</em>
(either by the players or by the Tellarite vessel that detected it) could
have allowed the Vulcan Space Agency to prepare a plan for the away team to
follow. One such sample plan is provided in <a href="#appendix-b-sample-vsa-plans">Appendix B: Sample VSA
Plan</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The mission scenes begin at <a href="#introduction">Scene 0: Introduction</a>. The following sections provide useful information for GMs on how to run a mission aboard the <em>Vaankara</em>.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-simply-destroy-the-vaankara">Why Not Simply Destroy the <em>Vaankara</em>?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-not-simply-destroy-the-vaankara" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Some players may wonder why they shouldn't simply destroy or disable the <em>Vaankara</em> after closing within weapons range. While this would effectively solve the core issue of violating Romulan Space, this is effectively the quickest way to a "Bad Ending" for this mission. The <em>Vaankara</em> is extremely damaged, and it is unlikely to be able to withstand any additional weapons fire. Indeed, the ship's Structure is a single breach from complete destruction, and as that is the most likely hit location, the risk is too great.</p>
<p>Destroying the <em>Vaankara</em> without ensuring that there are in fact no survivors and without even an attempt to salvage the craft is certain to cause a political incident with the Vulcan High Council. Starfleet Command will not look kindly upon officers that shoot first and ask questions later, especially where Coalition allies are concerned. The players would find themselves court martialed for dereliction of duty at a minimum, possibly multiple counts of murder if the Vulcan salvage vessel finds the corpses of recently killed Vulcans amongst the wreckage.</p>
<p>All of this information would be known by the players' characters, but the GM may need to remind players. It is not Starfleet's policy to open fire upon a defenseless vessel without cause, and Starfleet has no use for officers that feel otherwise.</p>

<p><img alt="VSA Vaankara" src="../img/dkyr_concept.png" /></p>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em> is a <em>D'Kyr</em>-Class, a multi-purpose cruiser more typically suited to combat operations than scientific or exploratory missions, though given the superior level of Vulcan technology <em>D'Kyr</em>-Class' scientific facilities easily rival the <em>NX</em>-Class'.</p>
<details class="note"><summary>Vessel Coordinates</summary><p>While <code>deck</code> is well understood as the Y-axis measure for a ship, there
hasn't been a clear way to refer to the X and Z positions. <code>Bulkhead</code> and
<code>Section</code> are sometimes used, albeit inconsistently. For this and other
missions, the recommended scheme is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Deck</strong> : Typical usage. Deck 1 is the highest deck, with increasing
    numbers descending through the ship. A compartment that spans multiple
    decks uses the lowest deck. For example, Main Engineering aboard an
    <em>NX</em>-Class vessel spans Decks D and E, so it would be labeled as Deck
    E.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Frame</strong> : A vertical plane, aligned with the 'ribs' of the ship, that
    describes the position of a compartment from fore to aft. Frame 1 is
    the foremost position, with increasing numbers aftward through the
    ship. The foremost bulkhead of a compartment defines the frame number.
    For example, a compartment spanning across Frames 10, 11, 12 would bear
    frame number 10.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Section</strong> : A vertical plane perpendicular to the 'ribs' of the ship
    which describes the distance from the centerline. Compartments that
    span the centerline have Section 0. Compartments completely port of the
    centerline have even section numbers (2, 4, 6), while compartments
    starboard of the centerline have odd section numbers (1, 3, 5).
    Increasing numbers denote a greater distance from the centerline,
    matching the 'runners' on the ship's keel. The center-most section
    number is used. For example, Main Engineering on an <em>NX</em>-Class vessel
    would use Section 0, as it spans the center, while the Captain's Ready
    Room would have Section 1, as it lies entirely to starboard of the
    centerline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Usage</strong> : One capital letter denoting the primary use of the
    compartment. The following table is borrowed heavily from the
    Naval equivalents.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>+---+----------------------------------------------+
| A | Storage (Cargohold, Issue Rooms, Storerooms) |

+---+----------------------------------------------+
</code></pre></div>

</li>
</ul>
<p>This scheme is basically the same one used aboard naval vessels, and is
relatively easy to parse for comparative purposes. For example, if players
are in a compartment labeled <code>E-120-4</code> and need to travel to another
labeled <code>D-100-5</code>, they would know to ascend one deck (E to D), head
forward (120 is aft of 100), and cross over to the starboard side of the
centerline (4 is even and therefore port, 5 is the equivalent section to
starboard).</p>
</details>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em> is composed a flattened, conical hull that flares out around a circular warp nacelle at the aft section. The circular nacelle can be rotated into the plane of the primary hull for combat. A detachable <em>Tal'Kyr</em> warp-capable support vessel docks to a hull extension inside the circular warp nacelle. The vessel consists of thirteen (13) decks. The table below contains a non-exhaustive list of major compartments and their approximate locations on the vessel.</p>

<p>Players should have rough schematic diagrams for the vessel from the Vulcan Database, so it is not unreasonable for them to pick a good beam-in point. All of the key compartments have an environmental effect that should prevent players from simply shutting down the warp drive.</p>
<p>An additional <a href="#appendix-a-compartment-complication-tables">Appendix A: Tables of Compartment Complications</a> is available at the end of the module for quick reference. This can be used to create or substitute hazards throughout the ship.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="navigating-around-the-vaankara">Navigating Around the <em>Vaankara</em><a class="headerlink" href="#navigating-around-the-vaankara" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>Moving between compartments is likely to be fraught with danger. The <em>Vaankara</em> crew will attack the away team on sight, and the various environmental hazards should provide quite the challenge for players.</p>
<p>To simulate the difficulty involved in traversing the ship, players should encounter about one or two hazards whenever they transfer between regions of the ship. If the traversal is short enough or the path has already been traversed, the hazards should be skipped to prevent burnout from the players.</p>
<p>The GM can make the journey more dynamic by presenting a choice of hazards the away team can face. </p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Presenting Choices</p>
<p>According to the <em>Vaankara</em> deck plans, there are two possible paths from
the Bridge to Main Engineering: via the turbolifts and corridors, or via
jefferies tubes. The former is more likely to attract the attention of the
<em>Vaankara</em> crew, and face atmospheric hazards like pressure differentials
or flooded compartments. The latter path, via jefferies tubes, is less
likely to encounter the crew, but significantly more likely to face energy
hazards, especially plasma fires and electrical discharges from co-located
EPS conduits.</p>
</div>
<p>The choices need not be mutually exclusive, and can allow for a backup option should the chosen method fail to provide safe passage. A journey that begun via the turbolifts could quickly require a trek through jefferies tubes if the lift becomes stuck between decks.</p>
<p>Additionally, players should be given the option to change their minds once they are presented with a specific hazard. Away teams can and often need to backtrack and find an alternate route in unknown environments, and flexibility and adaptability to changing conditions is a mark of a good officer.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="taking-control-of-the-vaankara">Taking Control of the <em>Vaankara</em><a class="headerlink" href="#taking-control-of-the-vaankara" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em> is on an automated course, determined by the ship's computer to the best of its ability to meet the heading locked by the ship's navigator before she scrambled the navigational subroutines. As the away team is not authorized to use the <em>Vaankara</em>'s systems, it is not a simple matter of just directing the computer to shut down the warp engines. The away team will need to manually collapse the <em>Vaankara</em>'s warp field, a dangerous proposition given that the ship's structural integrity is questionable at best.</p>
<p>There are several ways the <em>Vaankara</em> can be stopped. The primary impediments to the away team's mission are the various dangers aboard the <em>Vaankara</em>, ranging from the vessel's compromised environment to the psychotic surviving crew members.</p>
<p>From the <em>Endeavour</em>, the crew can attempt a <strong>Insight + Engineering</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Engineering</strong> with a Difficulty of 2 to determine the state of the <em>Vaankara</em>'s systems. If the Task is successful, the engineering analysis reveals the hazards located on the Bridge, Auxiliary Control Room, and Main Engineering as denoted in the <a href="#vaankara-main-compartments">Vaankara main compartments section</a>. The same Task additionally reveals that the <em>Vaankara</em> is liable to break up when it drops out of warp if the structural integrity is not reinforced prior to collapsing the warp field. Additional Momentum spends to Obtain Information can reveal the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <em>Tal'Kyr</em> support vessel appears to be in decent condition, as it has been powered down and sealed off from the main vessel.</li>
<li>The rotating warp nacelle shows signs of fatigue and stress, it could break off from the vessel with little warning.</li>
<li>Several emergency bulkheads have been lowered, sealing off parts of the ship that have been exposed to vacuum.</li>
<li>A small shuttlecraft appears to have smashed into the rear hull section. The other three shuttles are missing, and the bay is depressurized.</li>
<li><em>Repeatable:</em> The location of a structural weak spot that can be reinforced
  using internal force fields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once aboard the <em>Vaankara</em>, a similar <strong>Insight + Engineering</strong> Task with a  Difficulty of 2 can reveal the same information, if it was not acquired before boarding.</p>
<p>The following table shows the locations of structural weak points, as well as the Task needed to reinforce it. There is no ordering requirement for these Tasks, but they are all located in separate compartments of the ship.</p>

<p>Once the weak points have been taken care of, the warp field can be collapsed in several ways, each with its own risks and benefits.

<h3 id="securing-a-main-compartment">Securing a Main Compartment<a class="headerlink" href="#securing-a-main-compartment" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>As the <a href="#vaankara-main-compartments">Vaankara main compartments section</a> shows, many of the mission critical compartments are inaccessible to the away team upon beaming in. None of these hazards are meant to be impossible to correct, but they will require some degree of ingenuity and luck to come up with a solution.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the away team wishes to clear out the drive coolant preventing them from accessing Main Engineering.</p>
<p>They could attempt to override the security lockout at the computer terminal by the entrance to vent the compartment. This would be a <strong>Control + Security</strong> Extended Task with a Difficulty of 2, Resistance 2, and a Work Track of 12. Two (2) Breakthroughs are required to succeed. This option would require the away team to pass through corridors patrolled by the <em>Vaankara</em> crew. The players will need to work on the panel while under attack, which is not an ideal case.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the away team could attempt to access the environmental controls for Main Engineering inside a jefferies tube, the entrance of which has a <a href="#compartment-energy-hazards">plasma fire</a> that must be put out. This is a <strong>Daring + Security</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 4, and a Complication Range of 17-20. While significantly harder to pull off, the away team is unlikely to come under attack as the <em>Vaankara</em> crew tend to shun the jefferies tubes. The away team could attempt this route first, but failing to put out the plasma fire</p>
<p>In either event, clearing out the environmental hazard does not necessarily secure the compartment. The <em>Vaankara</em> crew may notice the away team's activity and mount an attack. Despite their psychosis, the crew have not lost their intelligence, and are perfectly capable of using the <em>Vaankara</em>'s systems against the away team. For example, they could release a toxic substance through the ventilation system, or they could attempt to overload a nearby EPS conduit to blow a hole through the bulkhead, allowing them access into the compartment.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, the players should feel a constant pressure to move on and avoid staying in any one location for too long. A lone crew member might discover them within minutes, and create enough of a ruckus to attract several others, which can quickly outnumber and overwhelm the away team.</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>Scene 0</em></p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">Captain's Log: Stardate 2161.8</p>
<p>Four hours ago, Starfleet received an emergency request from the Vulcan
High Council, requesting that the <em>Endeavour</em> be immediately dispatched
to the nearby Gamma Hydrae system along the disputed Romulan Border. A
Tellarite deep-space survey vessel picked up the <em>Vaankara</em>, a Vulcan
vessel lost in the Delphic Expanse four years ago, on long range sensors
seemingly heading directly for Romulan Space at approximately Warp 5.8. All
attempts to contact the <em>Vaankara</em> were unsuccessful, though given the
ship's final transmission that is perhaps to be expected.</p>
<p>The Tellarite ship was unable to catch up to the <em>Vaankara</em>, but
fortunately the captain was able to determine the ship's approximate
heading before it disappeared from their sensor range. Based on the
Vulcan's best estimates, the <em>Vaankara</em> will pass by the Cheron system in
about ten days, where the Romulan Star Empire has established a colony just
outside Coalition sensor range.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for the <em>Vaankara</em>'s mysterious heading, the Romulans
are sure to consider even a minor breach of their borders an act of
aggression. To have a Vulcan vessel pass by one of their colonies could
pull Vulcan and the Coalition into a pointless war. It is our mission to
ensure that the sovereignty of the Empire's borders is respected. The
<em>Endeavour</em> is to set an intercept course that will bring us within
transporter range of the <em>Vaankara</em> as it passes through Gamma Hydrae.
Though we will be unable to maintain speed with the Vulcan ship for long,
my engineer assures me the <em>Endeavour</em> can sustain Warp 5.8 for no less
than 90 seconds, just enough time to beam aboard an away team.</p>
<p>It will be up to them to disable the <em>Vaankara</em>'s warp drive, or failing
that, activate the ship's self-destruct and eject in one of the escape pods
before it crosses into Romulan space approximately four hours after our
intercept. A Vulcan salvage vessel is scheduled to rendezvous with us
within 48 hours. Should the away team succeed in safely stopping the
<em>Vaankara</em>, they will take over the somber task of finally laying this
ghost ship to rest.</p>
</div>
<hr />
<h2 id="intercept-with-the-vaankara">Intercept with the <em>Vaankara</em><a class="headerlink" href="#intercept-with-the-vaankara" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>Scene 1</em></p>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em> appears at extreme sensor range approximately 30 seconds before the <em>Endeavour</em> accelerates to Warp 5.8, a speed it can only hold for an extremely short period of time without suffering catastrophic damage to its engines.</p>
<p>The away team should already be at the transporter pad. Up to six (6) crew members can transport in a single cycle. If there are fewer than six players, they may choose additional members of the crew (NPCs or supporting characters) to accompany them, at the cost of one (1) <strong>Crew Support</strong> per character. A player may switch to control one of these additional crew members at the start of a scene for free, but cannot use <strong>Crew Support</strong> to bring in additional characters that did not transport over. If there are more than six (6) players, you may rationalize the greater transport capacity as a volumetric transport rather than an entity-transport, but increase the complication range for the transport Task by two (2) as the <em>Endeavour</em>'s transporter is not meant to transport humans in that mode.</p>
<p>Players should have access to the Vulcan Database, which will enable them to select a suitable beam in location. They may be tempted to choose an obvious compartment, like the Bridge or Main Engineering, but those compartments have highly hazardous environments that will necessitate an immediate evacuation (see <a href="#vsa-vaankara">the <em>Vaankara</em> compartment table</a>). A <strong>Reason + Science or Medicine</strong> Task assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Science</strong> with a Difficulty of 1 will reveal that major portions of the ship are badly damaged and all critical areas of the ship show hazardous conditions. For each Momentum spent to Obtain Information, the players can get information about one compartment or zone aboard the <em>Vaankara</em> from the <a href="#vsa-vaankara">the <em>Vaankara</em> compartment table</a>. Note that the crew members should <em>not</em> be recognized by the sensors as Vulcan, but should read as indeterminate humanoid life-forms.</p>
<p>As soon as the <em>Vaankara</em> enters the transporter window, the away team is on a timer to complete the transport. The window will last just 90 seconds, and the transporter takes at least 30 seconds to cycle. The Transporter Task is a <strong>Control + Engineering</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 and a Complication Range of 17+, assisted by the ship's <strong>Sensors + Engineering</strong>. This takes into account the +1 Difficulty increase due to the <em>Vaankara</em>'s non-functional Transporter Pad, and the -1 Difficulty decrease from performing the Task from the Transporter Room. The Transporter Task can Succeed at a Cost.</p>
<details class="failure"><summary>Transporter Complications</summary><ul>

<p>Aside from the optional <em>Plot an Intercept with the Vaankara</em>, all Tasks should be able to Succeed at a Cost. Non-optional failed Tasks should increase the Difficulty of the next Task downwards in the sequence. For example, <em>Close to Transporter Range</em> and <em>Locate a Suitable Beam-In Site</em> would both increase the Difficulty of <em>Set the Transporter to Automatic Cycle</em> if failed. If the final Task is failed, consider using one or more of the Transporter Complications from the <a href="#intercept-with-the-vaankara">standard Intercept description</a>.</p>
<p>If too many Tasks are failed, it is possible that the ship is unable to maintain distance with the <em>Vaankara</em>. This could lead to a new set of Engineering-related Tasks in order to squeeze additional speed out of the engines to allow a second attempt.</p>
<p>Ultimately, if too many Tasks are failed, it may come to pass that the crew has no other option but to abandon the boarding plan and proceed with the destruction of the <em>Vaankara</em>. Though not an positive outcome, as the destruction of the ship could result in <a href="#why-not-simply-destroy-the-vaankara">severe consequences for both the player characters specifically and Starfleet in general</a>, the crew did make their best attempt to intercept and salvage the <em>Vaankara</em>, a fact that won't be lost on the Vulcans or Starfleet Command. </p>
<p>If the attempt to board the <em>Vaankara</em> fails, consider playing out the court martial.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="aboard-the-vaankara">Aboard the <em>Vaankara</em><a class="headerlink" href="#aboard-the-vaankara" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><em>Scene 2</em></p>
<p>Once aboard, the away team will receive a signal from the <em>Endeavour</em> that it has reduced speed to the safe maximum of Warp 5.4. From this moment on, the away team is on its own and must complete the mission, otherwise they are sure to be captured or killed by the Romulans upon entering their territory.</p>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em> is in a terrible state. Every compartment has some problem, ranging from lack of artificial gravity to drive plasma leaks to extreme temperature variations. The player characters will need to stay in their EV suits throughout their mission, at least until they can secure and repair some compartment of the ship.</p>
<p>An environmental scan of the <em>Vaankara</em>, using a <strong>Reason + Medicine</strong> Task with Difficulty 1, reveals that the atmosphere (where it exists) is heavily contaminated with Trellium-D, a material known to protect against the effects of the spatial anomalies found in the Delphic Expanse.</p>
<p>Additional information may be obtained by spending Momentum.</p>
<ul>
<li>Several clusters of organic matter consistent with Vulcan corpses are detected on the scan, though the readings are unclear as to exactly how many bodies given the state of decomposition. Some of the clusters appear to be <em>moving</em>, though the readings are highly distorted, so it is possible that it is a sensor ghost.</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em>'s atmosphere contains large quantities of organic volatiles consistent with organic acids and solvents. Several compartments show damage to the bulkheads where these compounds have eaten away at the duranium alloys favored by Vulcan construction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of the walls have splatters consistent with sprays from blunt impacts. The splatters are old and dried out, but unmistakably rich in copper compounds typically found in Vulcanoid blood. The scans show trace amounts of the same organic acids and solvents, though in such minute quantities as to possibly be due to cross contamination over the years.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the <em>Enterprise</em> discovered, Trellium-D is extremely toxic to Vulcanoids, even brief exposure to minute quantities can lead to serious neurological damage. With the quantities found aboard the <em>Vaankara</em>, it's obvious that the crew would have quickly succumbed to Trellium induced psychosis and murdered each other.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to the players, the crew on the <em>Vaankara</em> is not entirely dead. Of an original crew complement of 147, there are 53 who did not perish in the outbreak of rage and violence that marked the ship's last transmission. Those so-called survivors have become shuffling husks completely devoid of any semblance of humanity. They are the <em>Ghosts of the Vaankara</em>, and they are consumed by an unquenchable rage.</p>
<p>Depending on where the away team beamed-in, it is possible that the putrid, dismembered bodies of the <em>Vaankara</em>'s crew can be found in the same compartment. A <strong>Reason + Medicine</strong> Task with Difficulty 1 will show that they died from injuries sustained during an all-out brawl. It is clear that the violence did not stop with their deaths, as all the corpses show signs of post-mortem dismemberment and even cannibalism.</p>
<p>At this time, it is up to the away team to determine the best course of action. The Vulcan High Council has requested a <a href="#additional-objectives">few additional objectives</a> for the away team to complete should the recovery efforts prove unsuccessful. Obviously these additional objectives are automatically met if the <em>Vaankara</em> is recovered, but they might provide some early destinations for the away team to visit. </p>
<p>If the away team is unsure of how to proceed, remember that as well-trained Starfleet officers, they should have a reasonable idea of how to disrupt an operational warp engine, if only from being told what <em>not</em> to do. Any of the <a href="#appendix-b-sample-vsa-plans">Sample VSA Plans</a> should reasonably occur to any member of the away team, even if it doesn't occur to the <em>players</em>.</p>

<p>However it happens, the <em>Vaankara</em>'s suicidal course has finally been halted. The <em>Endeavour</em> will soon catch up to the <em>Vaankara</em>, and the Vulcan recovery vessel, the <em>V'Laarrun</em>, will rendezvous within the day. The ship and its unfortunate survivors will finally return home to Vulcan. The crew members are too far gone from exposure to Trellium-D to ever be successfully re-integrated into society, but perhaps they will find a measure of peace at long last. </p>
<h3 id="vaankara-destroyed"><em>Vaankara</em> Destroyed<a class="headerlink" href="#vaankara-destroyed" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em>'s signal fades out on sensors as the ship is torn apart. Any remaining antimatter quickly detonates, ripping the hull apart from the inside and instantly killing anyone aboard. The <em>V'Laarrun</em>, the Vulcan recovery vessel, and the <em>Endeavour</em> have the somber task of combing through the wreckage in the faint hopes that something or someone survived the destruction of the ship, though after several hours of fruitless work the search is called off. There is nothing left but space debris and ghosts, forever cursed to drift aimlessly through space.</p>
<h3 id="in-all-cases">In All Cases<a class="headerlink" href="#in-all-cases" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p>At the suggestion of the <em>Endeavour</em>'s captain, the crews of the <em>Endeavour</em> and the <em>V'Laarrun</em> will hold a joint memorial service for the lost <em>Vaankara</em> crew members before the crippled ship is towed back home. Nistrav, the Vulcan commander leads the service from a darkened Galley.</p>
<div class="admonition quote">
<p class="admonition-title">In Memoriam</p>
<p>Nistrav stands before a small, spartan furnace, bathed in the primordial
red glow of coal embers. A number of red granite pillars ring the periphery
of the space cleared out for him, each bearing an inscription in Vulcan
of one of Surak's teachings. He is holding a small iron chalice. To his
right, wearing a borrowed robe, stands Captain Winchester of the <em>Endeavour</em>.
He is holding a small brass-colored gong.</p>
<p>"What we have experienced here today has come down from the time of the
beginning without change. This is the Vulcan heart. This is the Vulcan
soul. This is our way."</p>
<p>Nistrav gently tips the chalice forward, spilling water into the furnace.
the coals hiss as they are robbed of their heat. For a moment, Nistrav is
obscured by a crimson cloud of steam before the room is plunged deeper into
darkness, the coals having been fully extinguished. Only the faint glow of
candles illuminates the space.</p>
<p>"As it was at the time of the beginning, so it is now."</p>
<p>He sets the chalice on the ground and turns to the <em>Endeavour</em>'s captain with
a nod. Winchester rings the gong once, and begins reciting the list of the

<p>Unless otherwise specified, damage effects are either continuous (Difficulty or Complication Range increases), or attacks done once a Round at the <em>start</em> of a Round (ex: <code>3 dC</code> would be an environmental effect dealing 3 Challenge Dice of non-lethal damage to all affected characters).</p>

<p>Additionally, although not listed, each hazard could increase the Difficulty and/or Complication Range of some or all Tasks. It is up to the GM to determine which Tasks may or may not be affected. As a rule of thumb, if the Task directly depends on an environmental factor, increase the Difficulty (ex: scanning in a radiation field).

<h2 id="appendix-b-sample-vsa-plans">Appendix B: Sample VSA Plans<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-b-sample-vsa-plans" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<details class="summary"><summary>Shut Down Warp Core</summary><p>Shutting down the warp core is the most straightforward way to stop the
<em>Vaankara</em>. There are a few preparatory steps that must be taken, the knowledge
of which is obvious to any trained engineering officer.</p>
<p>First, the away team must secure the required compartments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Main Engineering or Auxiliary Control Room</li>
<li>Warp Nacelle Control Room</li>
</ul>
<p>Once secured, the away team can attempt a Group Challenge, consisting of two
main tasks: reduce warp power and maintain warp field stability.</p>
<p>The warp core's output power can be slowly lowered by manually adjusting
the matter/antimatter injectors. This is a <strong>Control or Daring +
Engineering</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 and a Complication Range of
18-20.</p>
<p>As the warp engines lose power, the field will destabilize and collapse. If
this collapse happens too suddenly, the <em>Vaankara</em> could be torn apart. A
member of the away team will need to be present at the Warp Nacelle Control
Room in order to perform manual adjustment of the coils. This is a <strong>Reason
+ Science</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 3.</p>
<p>If this task is failed, consider using a Timed Challenge to give the
players a chance to restore the warp field integrity before the field
collapses completely. Alternatively, the <em>Vaankara</em> could drop out of warp
and begin a series of explosive decompressions as the hull begins to
collapse in on itself. The players could be given a small amount of time to
reach an escape pod or the Tal'Kyr vessel while facing <a href="#appendix-a-compartment-complication-tables">compartment
hazards</a> along the way.</p>
<p>The primary hazards of this option come from attacks by the <em>Vaankara</em> crew,
which will attack the away team at both positions in waves. Since both control
rooms (or Main Engineering) contain a lot of sensitive equipment, weapons
discharges can cause extensive damage and result in new environmental hazards
(like coolant leaks, plasma fires, etc.). The Complication Range for energy
weapon shots should be quite large (15+ is recommended).</p>
</details>
<details class="summary"><summary>Use Tal'Kyr to Collapse Warp Field</summary><p>One creative option would be to use the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> support vessel to interfere
with the <em>Vaankara</em>'s warp bubble. Although not designed to sustain a warp
field large enough for both vessels, the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> should be more than able
to gently drop both ships out of warp. One additional benefit from the players'
perspectives is that the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> is devoid of <em>Vaankara</em> crew, and should
the plan go awry, is perfectly capable of acting like a massive lifeboat
for the away team.</p>
<p>Accessing the inside of the Tal'Kyr is relatively straightforward. From the
Docking Port, a <strong>Reason + Science</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 2 can bypass
the command code lockout on the vessel, or a <strong>Control + Security</strong> Task
also with a Difficult of 2 can be used to trigger an emergency evacuation
subroutine for the same effect.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the docking clamps are locked shut, and will need to be cut in
order to free the vessel. This is a <strong>Control + Engineering</strong> Task with a
Difficulty of 1. If appropriate cutting tools are not available, the Difficulty
increases by 1. Cutting tools can be found in Main Engineering, or another
suitable compartment.</p>
<p>Further complicating things, the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> is meant to be launched with the
Warp Nacelle stowed in the horizontal position, a task that is not possible
while at warp. The support vessel will need to be carefully piloted to
thread it between the nacelle and the ship's hull. By default, this will be
a <strong>Daring + Conn</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 5, but there are ways to
lower the difficulty.</p>
<p>By partially rotating the nacelle ring out of the way, the window through
which the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> can be piloted safely grows. This will lower the
Difficulty of the piloting task by 2, but it increases the complication
range by 2 (18-20) as the nacelle is not meant to be rotated while at warp.
The rotation can be performed from the Warp Nacelle Control Room with a
<strong>Daring + Engineering</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 1, and a Complication
Range of 19-20, to bypass the safety interlocks.</p>
<p>Additionally, the difficulty can be further lowered by scanning ahead to
find a window of "smooth" space where the <em>Vaankara</em> is not likely to
encounter turbulence or interference from passing stellar bodies. This
scan can be performed from any suitable control compartment (Bridge,
Auxiliary Control Room, Astrometrics, etc.) by passing a <strong>Reason +
Science</strong> Task with a Difficulty of 1.</p>
<p>As suggested above, this is a relatively safe way for the away team to de-warp
the <em>Vaankara</em>, and it is its own backup plan, as the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> can act as a
lifeboat should something go wrong. Still, there is always a risk that the
<em>Vaankara</em>'s warp field does not collapse quickly (shaking the ship apart) or
at all (in which case the vessel would continue on it's path unimpeded). In
the latter case, the <em>Tal'Kyr</em>'s weapons might allow for a shot or two, and if
done at point-blank range should be enough to destroy the ship.</p>
</details>
<details class="summary"><summary>Eject Antimatter Pods</summary><p>Ejecting the antimatter pods is a less controlled form of reducing the warp
reactor's power output by suddenly depriving it of reactants. Without a gentle
decrease in power, the warp field will collapse very suddenly, so this may be
a plan of last-resort. A <strong>Reason + Engineering</strong> Task with a Difficulty of
1 will reveal that there is at best a 50% chance that the <em>Vaankara</em> will
survive such a drastic fall out of warp. Anyone aboard the <em>Vaankara</em> will
be killed if the structure collapses.</p>
<p>The away team should ensure that the structural integrity of the ship is
boosted as much as possible, preferably by locating and reinforcing
additional structural weak points (GM's discretion).</p>
<p>From the Antimatter Storage Control, a <strong>Daring + Engineering</strong> Task with a
Difficulty of e can be used to trigger the ejection mechanism. This will
immediately eject the antimatter pods. The warp drive will then have a few
seconds (about a Task's worth) of residual power before the field
collapses. </p>
<p>It might be wise for the crew to set the ejection system on a timer (+1
Difficulty and +2 Complication Range, as it must be jury-rigged) so that
they can escape via the <em>Tal'Kyr</em> or an escape pod before the ship tumbles
out of warp.</p>
<p>However it happens, roll 1D6. On an even number, the <em>Vaankara</em>'s hull will
begin to collapse. The away team may be given a chance to escape the <em>Vaankara</em>
via escape pod (if they haven't already), but failure almost certainly means
death.</p>

<h2 id="appendix-c-trellium-d">Appendix C: Trellium-D<a class="headerlink" href="#appendix-c-trellium-d" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Trellium-D is a naturally occurring mineral that was used to insulate a ship's hull from the effects of the spatial anomalies within the Delphic Expanse.</p>
<p>Trellium is also a deadly neurotoxin to Vulcanoids, a fact that was tragically discovered by the crews of the <em>Vaankara</em> and the <em>Seleya</em>, though only the former had been confirmed. </p>
<div class="admonition health">
<p class="admonition-title">Trellium-D Psychosis</p>
<p>A lethal affliction for Vulcanoids, caused by the buildup of Trellium-D
in the synaptic pathways. Symptoms present as a loss of emotional control,
irritability, rapid mood swings, which if not treated immediately result
in irreversible damage and madness characterized by a complete loss of
impulse control. The following properties describe the Biological Hazard

<li>Permanent Psychosis after 24 Hours</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em>'s Sickbay contains records from the ship's physician detailing the crews rapid downfall into psychosis, as well as detailed scans of crew members at various stages of affliction.</p>
<p>The <em>Vaankara</em>'s Astrophysics Lab has experimental data about Trellium-D, and its protective properties against some forms of spatial anomalies. Alternatively, if the Computer Core can be accessed, sensor data from the Expanse can be downloaded, which includes scans of the anomalies.</p>
