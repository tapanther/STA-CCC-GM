The Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal mechanics experiments, which results in the Endeavour bridge crew not only being thrown forward and backward within their timeline, but across multiple alternate realities as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their own demise. Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of events out of order and across variations of parallel universes as a result of the strange radiation emanating from the crippled station resonating with the particles from an anti-radiation innoculation that only the player characters were able to receive before coming into range of the station. The effect cannot be reproduced, as once the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they will rapidly decompose. The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to leak into each other, often with lethal consequences. The players will need to reverse the experiment at the core of the laboratory to restore the boudaries between universes. Directives Directive Do Not Reveal Information About the Romulans.

With the Vulcan Space Agency fleet still recovering from First Minister T'Pau's house-cleaning, Starfleet Command has ordered us to lend whatever assistance the laboratory requires until a Vulcan aid vessel can be dispatched. I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency. Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the Endeavour , but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the recent ramblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all potential away team members be innoculated against a wide range of radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is performing the injections now. Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy. All Hands Abandon Ship! Scene 5 (T + 8 Hours) As the Endeavour prepares to drop out of warp, the crew feels a sudden lurch in their stomachs, as though the grav-plating has suddenly reversed polarity. The Shift You feel a sudden lurch in your stomach, as though the grav-plating had suddenly reversed polarity. Your hearing and vision are filled with a maddening superposition of millions of ghostly echoes. It's as if someone had overlaid a thousand takes of a movie scene, all carrying out the same actions and speaking the same words, but each one just slightly out of sync with the rest. As the specters dissipate away, you find yourself disoriented and carrying a profound sense of estrangement. The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the situation around the players has changed completely. Whereas the ship was previously operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves rocked and thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled ship. Tasks from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules. All players should attempt a Fitness + Security Task with a Difficulty of 2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are knocked prone, and will need to perform the Change Position Minor Task before they can perform any ship-related Task. A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours after the Endeavour 's arrival in the system. The main computer is severely damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship logs, are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading what has happened in those 8 hours. As the players look around the bridge, the sense of estrangement should only grow. Although this is clearly still the Endeavour , it is not their Endeavour . All of the Starfleet insignia are wrong, and the United Earth logos and inscriptions instead present themselves as the Earth Alliance. As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the doctor's innoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding themselves without any memories prior to dropping out of warp. As far as they are concerned the Endeavour was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain Winchester (NPC) was not among the innoculated, and orders all stations to provide a Damage Report unaware of what is going on with the players. Status Report What in the name of hell is going on here! This was supposed to be a rescue operation, we're not equipped to take on that many ships, and certainly not after getting caught with our proverbial pants down. We can't take much more of this. Helm, do your best to make us as small a target as possible. All stations, damage report! Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a Control + Command Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the Damage Report. Any attempt to question the Captain or the rest of the crew is met by a sharp rebuke and a direct order you carry out instructions. This is not the Time... Save the questions for if we get out of this mess. I gave you an order, I expect you to carry it out or relieve yourself of duty! This is not the time to daudle people!

Severely outnumbered by two dozen Kumari-Class vessels, the Endeavour will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then. The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack. This is the Captain... This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands abandon ship! Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods fail catastrophically and destroy the Endeavour . Just as the bridge fills with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point. Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory Scene 3 (T + 6 Hours) The players find themselves in EV Suits deep within a breached section of the station. The corridors are pitch black, the only lights are those coming from the group's helmet torches. The artificial gravity in this section has failed, and the suit's HUD indicates there is no breathable atmosphere. They are accompanied by a pair of figures in Vulcan-esque space suits, which bear the High Command's insignia. The EV suit HUD labels these figures as Subcommander V'Thena and Subaltern Skutt, both members of the Vulcan Security Forces, the V'Shar.

T'Var's Warning You should be approaching the air-gap now. The turbolifts are down, so you will need to descend carefully. Fortunately the security system is unpowered, otherwise your traversal would be significantly more difficult. Once you are inside the station core, you will need to reroute power to the station's communication channels, otherwise I will be unable to guide you further as the chamber is hardened against interference. If the players have questions for Subcommander V'Thena, they will find her quite dry and uninterested in conversation. What the Subcommander Knows Where are we? Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Endeavour is responding to a distress signal from the Laboratory, which came under attack by the Andorian Empire. Though ostensibly neutral, Starfleet has de-facto sided with the High Command. Why are we in this hallway? The experiment running in the station's core must be shut down. T'Var has determined that the experiment is causing spatio-temporal anomalies that threaten any vessel in the area. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? V'Thena does not want to speculate without additional information. All she knows is that there are pockets of survivors throughout the crippled station. What happened? The Andorian Imperial Guard attempted to take the station, but failing that resorted to attempting to destroy it. They have been repelled, but the damage is extensive. What happened earlier? A half dozen Imperial Guard attempted to take the principal scientists hostage, but was repelled thanks to the players' assistance. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currently chasing down the Andorian vessels that attacked the station. Why are the Andorians attacking? They are convinced that the High Command is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Why isn't the Coalition stopping them? What Coalition. If you're referring to the treaty of Galorndorn Core, everyone knows that the recent alliance between the High Command and the Romulan Star Empire was what precipitated this war in the first place. What is the history between Starfleet and the Vulcans/Romulans? Earth was a Vulcan protectorate until the Vulcan-Romulus treaty two years ago, whch elevated it to an independent stellar nation in gratitude for normalizing relations between the two empires. What have the scientists been working on? That information is beyond the Subcommander's clearance. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with a stern disapproval of humans asking illogical questions. As T'Var stated, the group quickly reaches a sealed airlock, which will require a Fitness + Security Task with a Difficulty of 3 to open. Alternatively, a Control + Engineering Task with the same difficulty can be attempted to jury-rig the airlock mechanism. Either task may Succeed at a Cost, which will take significantly more time and result in the security system's power being restored before the group can access the air-gap. The air-gap, as the name implies, is a pair of concenctric spheres with an evacuated gap in between. The only things connecting the inner shell to the outer one are a series of massive docking clamps, which engaged automatically when the station lost power. Normally the core is entirely disconnected from the rest of the station, and held in place with highly calibrated tractor beams. Travel between the two sides is limited to a pair of free-floating pods that ride along their own tractor beams, but the damage to the station knocked them loose from the moorings. They are currently free-floating within the gap. At some point during the traversal (or as the airlock is being opened if the players took too long), one of the other groups of survivors restores power to this section of the station, not knowing there was anyone inside. The security system activates, and a group of fixed phaser turrets begin to take aim at the group. With internal sensors down and the station ostensibly under attack, the security system has mistaken the group for saboteurs. Vulcan Phaser Turret Name: Phaser Turret Traits: Vulcan Robot Attributes: +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ | Control | 09 | Fitness | 12 | Presence | 00 | +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ | Daring | 08 | Insight | 07 | Reason | 07 | +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ Disciplines: +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ | Command | 01 | Security | 04 | Science | 00 | +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ | Conn | 00 | Engineering | 00 | Medicine | 00 | +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ Stress: 16 Resistance: 3 Attacks: +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ | Phaser Beam | R | 7 D | -- | Accurate | +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ Special Rules: - Immobile : Treat as though permanently Prone. The free-floating pods can be used to provide heavy cover (4 Cover Dice), but they require a Daring + Conn Task with a Difficulty of 3 to move using the EV jetsuits, and has a complication range of 18-20. The inner airlock must also be bypassed or forced open. If the turrets are still firing, the Task has a Difficulty of 4. Once inside the airlock however, the group will be safe from the turrets, only to be flung once again through time. Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory Scene 1 (T + 1 Hours) The Endeavour drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have expected before being catapulted into the Endeavour 's destruction. Once again however, there are subtle differences to everything, notably the governmental insignia, which reference EarthGov and EarthDome in place of UnitedEarth and Starfleet, respectively. The ship's logs are accessible, but with all the activity on the bridge there isn't much time to pour through every detail. As historical research is not typically part of bridge duty, access to the historical records is comparatively time consuming, and excessive requests will be noticed and reported to the Captain, who will humor a question or two but instruct the players to focus on the mission at hand. In any event the Captain will almost immediately begin issuing orders, leaving only a little bit of time for research. What the Endeavour's Log Shows Where are we? Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Endeavour is responding to a distress signal from the Laboratory, which came under attack by a Vulcan military fragment calling itself the Central Command. Has there been communication with the station? No. Only the automated distress signal. What happened earlier? EarthDome issued orders to the Endeavour to immediately detour from it's patrol route and render assistance. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where are the Vulcan attackers? Unknown, it's possible they got what they wanted and left, or they could be hiding nearby, ready to spring a trap. Why are the Vulcans attacking? Tensions between warring Vulcan factions and their former subjugate nations are at an all-time high. After the implosion of the Vulcan government and the subsequent breakup of their hegemony five years ago, some factions are trying to carve out a piece of the carcass for themselves. Why is the Endeavour helping? EarthDome considers improving relations with the Andorian Free State of paramount importance to planetary security. What is the history between EarthGov and the Vulcans/Andorians? As a minor, mostly autonomous protectorate not deemed particularly important, EarthGov weathered the collapse of the hegemony with only minor changes, but is in desperate need of allies against an upstart race, known as the Klingons, that were previously kept in check by the Vulcans. What have the station been working on? That information is not available. Other, more detailed questions will simply return a warning that EarthGov resources are not to be utilized for personal projects. A scan of the station requires a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been activated. A Control + Engineering Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes. The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should the Endeavour strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players may attempt a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once detected, the anomalies can be Charted using a Reason + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Conn with a Difficulty of 3. A successful Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 Daring + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Engines + Conn . A closer study of the anomalies with a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the experiment by 2. Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the station, they will be reminded that EarthGov owes the Andorian Free State a great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet has issued specific instructions that the Endeavour is to render any and all assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders. Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be dispatched aboard shuttlepods. Once the Endeavour has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again. Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours) The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station, surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship communications are being jammed. Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces are written in an unknown script. An Insight + Command Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as an offshoot of ancient Vulcan.

Rifle | R | 6 D | 2H | Vicious 1, Accurate | +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking them to be a human peculiarity. A closer inspection of their faces reveals that she looks almost identical to Subcommander V'Thena and one of the Romulan guards, Enuhlan Vrolmut, resembles Subaltern Skutt. Unlike their Vulcan doppelgangers, these Romulans are charismatic and jovial, and seem quite friendly. What the Centurion Knows Where are we? Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Romulan Republic received intelligence that a Klingon assault force was underway to sabotage the station. Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the Endeavour responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can be dispatched. Why are we in this hallway? The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the Klingon boarding party is dealt with. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell. What happened? A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched, but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currently chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the assault team from being retrieved. Why are the Klingons attacking? They are convinced that the Republic is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Where are the Vulcans? Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history. How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied? Officially, 2 years, ever since the Enterprise came to the Republic's aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with. How many Klingons do we expect? No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be all that survived in this section of the station. What have the scientists been working on? No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier. None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers approaching.

Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one. If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As the emergency shelter is open, the scientists can be probed for additional information about their experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar, insists that he must get back to the laboratory core, as the station and everyone in it are in grave danger. Tolvar Name: Tolvar Traits: Romulan Attributes: +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ | Control | 09 | Fitness | 10 | Presence | 07 | +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ | Daring | 07 | Insight | 08 | Reason | 10 | +----------+----+-----------+----+-----------+----+ Disciplines: +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ | Command | 02 | Security | 01 | Science | 02 | +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ | Conn | 01 | Engineering | 00 | Medicine | 00 | +---------+----+-------------+----+----------+----+ Stress: 11 Resistance: 0 Attacks: +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ | Unarmed | M | 2 D | 1H | Knockdown, Non-Lethal | +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ | Disruptor | R | 4 D | 1H | Vicious 1 | +----------------+---+------+----+--------------------------+ Special Rules: - Learning Through Adversity : May roll an additional d20 on a Science Task, as long as they previously failed a Science Task in the same field. Tolvar's Worries Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been pouring through the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between realities. Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a Reason + Science Task with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. If the Task is failed or not attempted, Tolvar will spend additional time explaining the data and therefore reducing the time available for additional questions. In any event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of Tolvar's analysis. If the players successfully follow Tolvar's explanation, they will gain an important insight into the experiment still underway deep within the station's core, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform the Tasks. If the players reveal that they are from an alternate reality, they will discover that Tolvar is one of the only characters that will take them seriously. He will excitedly ask about the players' reality, but won't get too far in his questioning before Lithena interrupts. A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core. In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber. Unknown Abandoned Space Station Scene 4 (T + 7 Hours) The players are inside the central core of the station, still in EV suits though there are emergency lights available. The artificial gravity is weak but functional. Unlike other realities, the players are utterly alone in this iteration. It appears that the station's crew has been killed recently. The corpses of various species can be found strewn around, apparently suffocated as the station's life support failed. A mixed complement of Vulcanoids and Andorians can be found, but their insignia are not recognized. An Insight + Medicine Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the Vulcanoids fall somewhere between a Vulcan and a Romulan. A Momentum spend further reveals that the two races must have recombined at some point in the past 700 years. Communications with the Endeavour are not available, as the core is heavily shielded against interference. A review of the station's log show that most entries are irreversibly encrypted, and the controls have all been locked out. The experiment involves a massive particle accelerator, which must be properly quenched to prevent an explosion that could destroy the station. This is a Gated Challenge that requires multiple characters to perform a set of actions. If the group succeeded in following Tolvar's explanation, the Difficulty of these Tasks is reduced by 2. Similarly, if the players previously gathered detailed information about the anomalies, the complication range of these checks is reduced by two.

All of the tasks can Succeed at a Cost, though the mounting complications mean that the station's systems suffer damage in the process. If the final Quench operation is not successful, the experiment still shuts down, but a power overload in the station's reactors quickly builds. The effect is irreversible, and the station will be destroyed. Regardless of the outcome, just as the final exotic particles are annihilated, a surge of radiation kicks the players forward in time. Vucan Science Directorate T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory Finale (T + 10 Hours) The players find themselves aboard the bridge of the Endeavour . Depending on the outcome of the previous scene, the atmosphere can be drastically different. Fortunately for the players, it appears they are back in their Endeavour at last. Experiment Successfully Reversed If the players successfully reverse the effects of the experiment, they find the bridge filled with members of the Vulcan science and security teams that survived and are helping the Endeavour crew supervise further rescue and repair operations. The tactical officer will note that a fleet of Andorian ships has arrived. They hail the Endeavour , and offer their assistance with the rescue effort. Despite the decades of animosity between the two nations, the Andorians seem earnest in their offer. The ranking Vulcan officer graciously accepts the Andorian's help, and makes a point of stating that such a scenario would have been unthinkable without humanity's intervention to create the Coalition. Laboratory Destroyed If the attempt at halting the experiment resulted in failure, the station's reactors are on the verge of detonation. The bridge is clear, save for perhaps one or two scientists that survived the ordeal, including Doctor Stolvar. They lament the loss of the station, and watch stoicly as the station's reactors explode, tearing the station apart. Long range sensors pick up an Andorian fleet just as it opens a hail. The Andorian commander expresses regret that the Vulcans did not heed their repeated warnings to increase security measures throughout the sector. He adds that the Andorian delegation to the Coalition will be presenting this incident as evidence that the Vulcan High Council is woefully unprepared to take over the running of the Vulcan government. Regardless, he offers to assist in the salvage efforts in hopes that at least some of the station's personnel can have an honorable burial. In Either Event A review of the ship's database reveals that everything is as it should be. The player's actions across the various leaked realities appear to have been mirrored here, though rather than fighting a Klingon or Andorian complement it was a group of Orion pirates hoping to make off with secret military technology. Should the players decide to reveal the particulars of their experience hopping between realities, one of the nearby Vulcan scientists, Doctor Stolvar, will engage in conversation. The scientist admits that there was data that could not be directly explained, but the Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that any kind of travel between alternative realities is impossible. A Reason + Medicine Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that it was the doctor's innoculation, coupled with a fresh exposure to the strange radiation from the still-running experiment caused the players to experience these 'reality shifts'. Doctor Stolvar however suggests that it is more likely that the away team simply suffered hallucinations as a result of the exposure.","title":"Time Skips (Mission 5)"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#time-skips-mission-5","text":"","title":"Time Skips (Mission 5)"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#description","text":"An experiment gone wrong abord the Vulcan Science Directorate's T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory leads the Endeavour crew to a Vulcan/Andorian border system to render assistance. The Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal mechanics experiments, which results in the Endeavour bridge crew not only being thrown forward and backward within their timeline, but across multiple alternate realities as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their own demise. Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of events out of order and across variations of parallel universes as a result of the strange radiation emanating from the crippled station resonating with the particles from an anti-radiation innoculation that only the player characters were able to receive before coming into range of the station. The effect cannot be reproduced, as once the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they will rapidly decompose. The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to leak into each other, often with lethal consequences.

I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency. Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the Endeavour , but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the recent ramblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry.

The Shift You feel a sudden lurch in your stomach, as though the grav-plating had suddenly reversed polarity. Your hearing and vision are filled with a maddening superposition of millions of ghostly echoes. It's as if someone had overlaid a thousand takes of a movie scene, all carrying out the same actions and speaking the same words, but each one just slightly out of sync with the rest. As the specters dissipate away, you find yourself disoriented and carrying a profound sense of estrangement. The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the situation around the players has changed completely. Whereas the ship was previously operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves rocked and thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled ship. Tasks from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules. All players should attempt a Fitness + Security Task with a Difficulty of 2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are knocked prone, and will need to perform the Change Position Minor Task before they can perform any ship-related Task. A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours after the Endeavour 's arrival in the system. The main computer is severely damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship logs, are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading what has happened in those 8 hours. As the players look around the bridge, the sense of estrangement should only grow. Although this is clearly still the Endeavour , it is not their Endeavour . All of the Starfleet insignia are wrong, and the United Earth logos and inscriptions instead present themselves as the Earth Alliance. As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the doctor's innoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding themselves without any memories prior to dropping out of warp. As far as they are concerned the Endeavour was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain Winchester (NPC) was not among the innoculated, and orders all stations to provide a Damage Report unaware of what is going on with the players. Status Report What in the name of hell is going on here! This was supposed to be a rescue operation, we're not equipped to take on that many ships, and certainly not after getting caught with our proverbial pants down. We can't take much more of this. Helm, do your best to make us as small a target as possible. All stations, damage report! Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a Control + Command Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the Damage Report. Any attempt to question the Captain or the rest of the crew is met by a sharp rebuke and a direct order you carry out instructions. This is not the Time... Save the questions for if we get out of this mess. I gave you an order, I expect you to carry it out or relieve yourself of duty! This is not the time to daudle people!

Severely outnumbered by two dozen Kumari-Class vessels, the Endeavour will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then. The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack. This is the Captain... This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands abandon ship! Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods fail catastrophically and destroy the Endeavour . Just as the bridge fills with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point.","title":"All Hands Abandon Ship!"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#vulcan-high-command-tshuvath-stellar-laboratory","text":"Scene 3 (T + 6 Hours) The players find themselves in EV Suits deep within a breached section of the station. The corridors are pitch black, the only lights are those coming from the group's helmet torches. The artificial gravity in this section has failed, and the suit's HUD indicates there is no breathable atmosphere. They are accompanied by a pair of figures in Vulcan-esque space suits, which bear the High Command's insignia.

T'Var's Warning You should be approaching the air-gap now. The turbolifts are down, so you will need to descend carefully. Fortunately the security system is unpowered, otherwise your traversal would be significantly more difficult. Once you are inside the station core, you will need to reroute power to the station's communication channels, otherwise I will be unable to guide you further as the chamber is hardened against interference. If the players have questions for Subcommander V'Thena, they will find her quite dry and uninterested in conversation. What the Subcommander Knows Where are we? Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Endeavour is responding to a distress signal from the Laboratory, which came under attack by the Andorian Empire. Though ostensibly neutral, Starfleet has de-facto sided with the High Command. Why are we in this hallway? The experiment running in the station's core must be shut down. T'Var has determined that the experiment is causing spatio-temporal anomalies that threaten any vessel in the area. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? V'Thena does not want to speculate without additional information. All she knows is that there are pockets of survivors throughout the crippled station. What happened? The Andorian Imperial Guard attempted to take the station, but failing that resorted to attempting to destroy it. They have been repelled, but the damage is extensive. What happened earlier? A half dozen Imperial Guard attempted to take the principal scientists hostage, but was repelled thanks to the players' assistance. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currently chasing down the Andorian vessels that attacked the station. Why are the Andorians attacking? They are convinced that the High Command is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Why isn't the Coalition stopping them? What Coalition. If you're referring to the treaty of Galorndorn Core, everyone knows that the recent alliance between the High Command and the Romulan Star Empire was what precipitated this war in the first place. What is the history between Starfleet and the Vulcans/Romulans? Earth was a Vulcan protectorate until the Vulcan-Romulus treaty two years ago, whch elevated it to an independent stellar nation in gratitude for normalizing relations between the two empires. What have the scientists been working on? That information is beyond the Subcommander's clearance. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with a stern disapproval of humans asking illogical questions. As T'Var stated, the group quickly reaches a sealed airlock, which will require a Fitness + Security Task with a Difficulty of 3 to open. Alternatively, a Control + Engineering Task with the same difficulty can be attempted to jury-rig the airlock mechanism. Either task may Succeed at a Cost, which will take significantly more time and result in the security system's power being restored before the group can access the air-gap. The air-gap, as the name implies, is a pair of concenctric spheres with an evacuated gap in between. The only things connecting the inner shell to the outer one are a series of massive docking clamps, which engaged automatically when the station lost power. Normally the core is entirely disconnected from the rest of the station, and held in place with highly calibrated tractor beams. Travel between the two sides is limited to a pair of free-floating pods that ride along their own tractor beams, but the damage to the station knocked them loose from the moorings. They are currently free-floating within the gap. At some point during the traversal (or as the airlock is being opened if the players took too long), one of the other groups of survivors restores power to this section of the station, not knowing there was anyone inside. The security system activates, and a group of fixed phaser turrets begin to take aim at the group. With internal sensors down and the station ostensibly under attack, the security system has mistaken the group for saboteurs.

The free-floating pods can be used to provide heavy cover (4 Cover Dice), but they require a Daring + Conn Task with a Difficulty of 3 to move using the EV jetsuits, and has a complication range of 18-20. The inner airlock must also be bypassed or forced open. If the turrets are still firing, the Task has a Difficulty of 4. Once inside the airlock however, the group will be safe from the turrets, only to be flung once again through time.","title":"Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#andorian-free-state-shothethal-stellar-laboratory","text":"Scene 1 (T + 1 Hours) The Endeavour drops out of warp, almost exactly as the players would have expected before being catapulted into the Endeavour 's destruction. Once again however, there are subtle differences to everything, notably the governmental insignia, which reference EarthGov and EarthDome in place of UnitedEarth and Starfleet, respectively. The ship's logs are accessible, but with all the activity on the bridge there isn't much time to pour through every detail. As historical research is not typically part of bridge duty, access to the historical records is comparatively time consuming, and excessive requests will be noticed and reported to the Captain, who will humor a question or two but instruct the players to focus on the mission at hand. In any event the Captain will almost immediately begin issuing orders, leaving only a little bit of time for research. What the Endeavour's Log Shows Where are we? Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Endeavour is responding to a distress signal from the Laboratory, which came under attack by a Vulcan military fragment calling itself the Central Command. Has there been communication with the station? No. Only the automated distress signal. What happened earlier? EarthDome issued orders to the Endeavour to immediately detour from it's patrol route and render assistance. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where are the Vulcan attackers? Unknown, it's possible they got what they wanted and left, or they could be hiding nearby, ready to spring a trap. Why are the Vulcans attacking? Tensions between warring Vulcan factions and their former subjugate nations are at an all-time high. After the implosion of the Vulcan government and the subsequent breakup of their hegemony five years ago, some factions are trying to carve out a piece of the carcass for themselves. Why is the Endeavour helping? EarthDome considers improving relations with the Andorian Free State of paramount importance to planetary security. What is the history between EarthGov and the Vulcans/Andorians? As a minor, mostly autonomous protectorate not deemed particularly important, EarthGov weathered the collapse of the hegemony with only minor changes, but is in desperate need of allies against an upstart race, known as the Klingons, that were previously kept in check by the Vulcans. What have the station been working on? That information is not available. Other, more detailed questions will simply return a warning that EarthGov resources are not to be utilized for personal projects. A scan of the station requires a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been activated. A Control + Engineering Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes. The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should the Endeavour strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players may attempt a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once detected, the anomalies can be Charted using a Reason + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Conn with a Difficulty of 3. A successful Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 Daring + Conn Task assisted by the ship's Engines + Conn . A closer study of the anomalies with a Reason + Science Task assisted by the ship's Sensors + Science with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the experiment by 2. Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the station, they will be reminded that EarthGov owes the Andorian Free State a great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet has issued specific instructions that the Endeavour is to render any and all assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders. Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be dispatched aboard shuttlepods. Once the Endeavour has made it to the station, or become crippled by the anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.","title":"Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#romulan-federal-republic-sethika-stellar-laboratory","text":"Scene 2 (T + 3 Hours) The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station, surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship communications are being jammed. Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces are written in an unknown script. An Insight + Command Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as an offshoot of ancient Vulcan.

If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking them to be a human peculiarity. A closer inspection of their faces reveals that she looks almost identical to Subcommander V'Thena and one of the Romulan guards, Enuhlan Vrolmut, resembles Subaltern Skutt. Unlike their Vulcan doppelgangers, these Romulans are charismatic and jovial, and seem quite friendly. What the Centurion Knows Where are we? Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory Why are we here? The Romulan Republic received intelligence that a Klingon assault force was underway to sabotage the station. Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the Endeavour responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can be dispatched. Why are we in this hallway? The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the Klingon boarding party is dealt with. Where is the rest of the station's personnel? Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell. What happened? A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched, but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated. What is the station's current status? Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell. Where is the Endeavour ? Currently chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the assault team from being retrieved. Why are the Klingons attacking? They are convinced that the Republic is using the laboratory to develop weapons of mass destruction, a patently ridiculous idea. Where are the Vulcans? Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history. How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied? Officially, 2 years, ever since the Enterprise came to the Republic's aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with. How many Klingons do we expect? No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be all that survived in this section of the station. What have the scientists been working on? No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over. Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier. None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers approaching.

Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one. If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As the emergency shelter is open, the scientists can be probed for additional information about their experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar, insists that he must get back to the laboratory core, as the station and everyone in it are in grave danger.

Tolvar's Worries Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been pouring through the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between realities. Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a Reason + Science Task with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. If the Task is failed or not attempted, Tolvar will spend additional time explaining the data and therefore reducing the time available for additional questions. In any event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of Tolvar's analysis. If the players successfully follow Tolvar's explanation, they will gain an important insight into the experiment still underway deep within the station's core, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform the Tasks. If the players reveal that they are from an alternate reality, they will discover that Tolvar is one of the only characters that will take them seriously. He will excitedly ask about the players' reality, but won't get too far in his questioning before Lithena interrupts. A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core. In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber.","title":"Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"TimeSkip/#unknown-abandoned-space-station","text":"Scene 4 (T + 7 Hours) The players are inside the central core of the station, still in EV suits though there are emergency lights available. The artificial gravity is weak but functional. Unlike other realities, the players are utterly alone in this iteration. It appears that the station's crew has been killed recently. The corpses of various species can be found strewn around, apparently suffocated as the station's life support failed. A mixed complement of Vulcanoids and Andorians can be found, but their insignia are not recognized. An Insight + Medicine Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the Vulcanoids fall somewhere between a Vulcan and a Romulan. A Momentum spend further reveals that the two races must have recombined at some point in the past 700 years. Communications with the Endeavour are not available, as the core is heavily shielded against interference. A review of the station's log show that most entries are irreversibly encrypted, and the controls have all been locked out. The experiment involves a massive particle accelerator, which must be properly quenched to prevent an explosion that could destroy the station.

Laboratory Destroyed If the attempt at halting the experiment resulted in failure, the station's reactors are on the verge of detonation. The bridge is clear, save for perhaps one or two scientists that survived the ordeal, including Doctor Stolvar. They lament the loss of the station, and watch stoicly as the station's reactors explode, tearing the station apart. Long range sensors pick up an Andorian fleet just as it opens a hail. The Andorian commander expresses regret that the Vulcans did not heed their repeated warnings to increase security measures throughout the sector. He adds that the Andorian delegation to the Coalition will be presenting this incident as evidence that the Vulcan High Council is woefully unprepared to take over the running of the Vulcan government. Regardless, he offers to assist in the salvage efforts in hopes that at least some of the station's personnel can have an honorable burial. In Either Event A review of the ship's database reveals that everything is as it should be. The player's actions across the various leaked realities appear to have been mirrored here, though rather than fighting a Klingon or Andorian complement it was a group of Orion pirates hoping to make off with secret military technology. Should the players decide to reveal the particulars of their experience hopping between realities, one of the nearby Vulcan scientists, Doctor Stolvar, will engage in conversation. The scientist admits that there was data that could not be directly explained, but the Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that any kind of travel between alternative realities is impossible. A Reason + Medicine Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that it was the doctor's innoculation, coupled with a fresh exposure to the strange radiation from the still-running experiment caused the players to experience these 'reality shifts'. Doctor Stolvar however suggests that it is more likely that the away team simply suffered hallucinations as a result of the exposure.","title":"Vucan Science Directorate T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory"},{"location":"Timeline/","text":"Timeline Year Event Description","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"Timeline/#timeline","text":"Year Event Description","title":"Timeline"},{"location":"WarGames/","text":"War Games (Mission 3) Description TEXT TEXT TEXT TEXT COL1 COL2 ROW1COL1 ROW2COL2","title":"War Games (Mission 3)"},{"location":"WarGames/#war-games-mission-3","text":"","title":"War Games (Mission 3)"},{"location":"WarGames/#description","text":"TEXT","title":"Description"},{"location":"WarGames/#text","text":"TEXT TEXT COL1 COL2 ROW1COL1 ROW2COL2","title":"TEXT"}]}
