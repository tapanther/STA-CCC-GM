  Description: >-
    The *Vaankara*, Vulcan spaceship long-thought lost to the Delphic Expanse
    re-appears on long-range sensors traveling at high warp towards a Romulan colony.
    All attempts to contact the vessel have failed, though that is to be expected as
    the Vulcan High Command had received a transmission from the *Vaankara* showing
    the crew killing each other violently as a result of Trellium-D induced
    psychosis. The ship is travelling slightly too fast for the Endeavour's Warp Five
    engine to keep up with, but it should be possible to match velocities just long
    enough for a small away team to transport aboard and shut down the *Vaankara*'s
    warp engines before it crosses into Romulan territory.

    Title: Why Not Simply Destroy the *Vaankara*?
    Text: >-
      Some players may wonder why they shouldn't simply destroy or disable the
      *Vaankara* after closing within weapons range. While this would effectively
      solve the core issue of violating Romulan Space, this is effectively the
      quickest way to a "Bad Ending" for this mission. The *Vaankara* is extremely
      damaged, and it is unlikely to be able to withstand any additional weapons
      fire. Indeed, the ship's Structure is a single breach from complete destruction,
      and as that is the most likely hit location, the risk is too great.

      
      Destroying the *Vaankara* without ensuring that there are in fact no survivors
      and without even an attempt to salvage the craft is certain to cause a
      political incident with the Vulcan High Council. Starfleet Command will not
      look kindly upon officers that shoot first and ask questions later, especially
      where Coalition allies are concerned. The players would find themselves court
      martialed for dereliction of duty at a minimum, possibly multiple counts of
      murder if the Vulcan salvage vessel finds the corpses of recently killed
      Vulcans amongst the wreckage.


      All of this information would be known by the players' characters, but the GM
      may need to remind players. It is not Starfleet's policy to open fire upon a
      defenseless vessel without cause, and Starfleet has no use for officers that
      feel otherwise.

    Title: VSA Vaankara
    Text: >-
      The *Vaankara* is a *D'Kyr*-Class, a multi-purpose cruiser more typically
      suited to combat operations than scientific or exploratory missions, though
      given the superior level of Vulcan technology *D'Kyr*-Class' scientific
      facilities easily rival the *NX*-Class'.


      The *Vaankara* is composed a flattened, conical hull that flares out around a
      circular warp nacelle at the aft section. The circular nacelle can be rotated
      into the plane of the primary hull for combat. A detachable *Tal'Kyr*
      warp-capable support vessel docks to a hull extension inside the circular warp
      nacelle. The vessel consists of thirteen (13) decks. The table below contains
      a non-exhaustive list of major compartments and their approximate locations on
      the vessel.

      
      !!! note "Vessel Coordinates"

          While `deck` is well understood as the Y-axis measure for a ship, there
          hasn't been a clear way to refer to the X and Z positions. `Bulkhead` and
          `Section` are sometimes used, albeit inconsistently. For this and other
          missions, the recommended scheme is as follows:

            - **Deck** : Typical usage. Deck 1 is the highest deck, with increasing
              numbers descending through the ship. A compartment that spans multiple
              decks uses the lowest deck. For example, Main Engineering aboard an
              *NX*-Class vessel spans Decks D and E, so it would be labeled as Deck
              E.

            - **Frame** : A vertical plane, aligned with the 'ribs' of the ship, that
              describes the position of a compartment from fore to aft. Frame 1 is
              the foremost position, with increasing numbers aftward through the
              ship. The foremost bulkhead of a compartment defines the frame number.
              For example, a compartment spanning across Frames 10, 11, 12 would bear
              frame number 10.

            - **Section** : A vertical plane perpendicular to the 'ribs' of the ship
              which describes the distance from the centerline. Compartments that
              span the centerline have Section 0. Compartments completely port of the
              centerline have even section numbers (2, 4, 6), while compartments
              starboard of the centerline have odd section numbers (1, 3, 5).
              Increasing numbers denote a greater distance from the centerline,
              matching the 'runners' on the ship's keel. The center-most section
              number is used. For example, Main Engineering on an *NX*-Class vessel
              would use Section 0, as it spans the center, while the Captain's Ready
              Room would have Section 1, as it lies entirely to starboard of the
              centerline.

            - **Usage** : One capital letter denoting the primary use of the
              compartment. The following table is borrowed heavily from the
              Naval equivalents.

              ```

              +---+----------------------------------------------+
              | T | Jefferies Tube                               |
              +---+----------------------------------------------+
              | V | Void (Empty Spaces)                          |
              +---+----------------------------------------------+
              | W | Water Tank                                   |
              +---+----------------------------------------------+
              ```

          This scheme is basically the same one used aboard naval vessesls, and is
          relatively easy to parse for comparative purposes. For example, if players
          are in a compartment labeled `E-120-4` and need to travel to another
          labeled `D-100-5`, they would know to ascend one deck (E to D), head
          forward (120 is aft of 100), and cross over to the starboard side of the
          centerline (4 is even and therefore port, 5 is the equivalent section to
          starboard).

      Players should have rought schematic diagrams for the vessel from the Vulcan

      of the key compartments have an environmental effect that should prevent players
      from simply shutting down the warp drive.

    Title: Taking Control of the *Vaankara*
    Text: >-
      The *Vaankara* is on an automated course, determined by the ship's computer to
      the best of its ability to meet the heading locked by the ship's navigator
      before she scrambled the navigational subroutines. As the away team is not
      authorized to use the *Vaankara*'s systems, it is not a simple matter of just
      directing the computer to shut down the warp engines. The away team will need
      to manually collapse the *Vaankara*'s warp field, a dangerous proposition given
      that the ship's structural integrity is questionable at best.


      There are several ways the *Vaankara* can be stopped. The primary impediments
      to the away team's mission are the various dangers aboard the *Vaankara*, ranging
      from the vessel's compromised environment to the psychotic surviving crewmembers.
      

      From the *Endeavour*, the crew can attempt a **Insight + Engineering** Task
      assissted by the ship's **Sensors + Engineering** with a Difficulty of 2 to
      determine the state of the *Vaankara*'s systems. If the Task is successful, the
      engineering analysis reveals the hazards located on the Bridge, Auxiliary
      Control Room, and Main Engineering as denoted in the [Vaankara main
      compartments section](#vaankara-main-compartments). The same Task additionally
      reveals that the *Vaankara* is liable to break up when it drops out of warp if
      the structural integrity is not reinforced prior to collapsing the warp field.
      Additional Momentum spends to Obtain Information can reveal the following
      information:


      - The *Tal'Kyr* support vessel appears to be in decent condition, as it has
      been powered down and sealed off from the main vessel.

      - The rotating warp nacelle shows signs of fatigue and stress, it could break off
      from the vessel with little warning.

      - Several emergency bulkheads have been lowered, sealing off parts of the ship
      that have been exposed to vacuum.

      - A small shuttlecraft appears to have smashed into the rear hull section. The
      other three shuttles are missing, and the bay is depressurized.

      - *Repeatable:* The location of a structural weak spot that can be reinforced
        using internal force fields.

      
      Once aboard the *Vaankara*, a similar **Insight + Engineering** Task with a 
      Difficulty of 2 can reval the same information, if it was not acquired before
      boarding.


      The following table shows the locations of structural weak points, as well as
      the Task needed to reinforce it. There is no ordering requirement for these
      Tasks, but they are all located in separate compartments of the ship.

      Once the weak points have been taken care of, the warp field can be collapsed in
      several ways, each with its own risks and benefits. The following table is not a
      comprehensive list of possibilities, but simply lists out some options. Players
      should be encouraged to come up with their own method. Extended descriptions are

    Subtitle: Shut Down Warp Core
    Text: >-
      Shutting down the warp core is the most straightforward way to stop the
      *Vaankara*. There are a few preparatory steps that must be taken, the knowledge
      of which is obvious to any trained engineering officer.

      
      First, the away team must secure the required compartments:

      - Main Engineering or Auxiliary Control Room
      - Warp Nacelle Control Room

      
      Once secured, the warp core's output power can be slowly lowered by manually
      adjusting the matter/antimatter injectors. As the warp engines lose power, the
      field will destabilize, requiring manual adjustment of the coils from within
      the Warp Nacelle Control Room to prevent too sudden a collapse, which would
      tear the *Vaankara* apart.


      The primary hazards of this option come from attacks by the *Vaankara* crew,
      which will attack the away team at both positions in waves. Since both control
      rooms (or Main Engineering) contain a lot of sensitive equipment, weapons
      discharges can cause extensive damage and result in new environmental hazards
      (like coolant leaks, plasma fires, etc.). The Complication Range for energy
      weapon shots should be quite large (15+ is recommended).
  -
    Subtitle: Use Tal'Kyr to Collapse Warp Field
    Text: >-
      One creative option would be to use the *Tal'Kyr* support vessel to interfere
      with the *Vaankara*'s warp bubble. Although not designed to sustain a warp
      field large enough for both vessels, the *Tal'Kyr* should be more than able
      to gently drop both ships out of warp. One additional benefit from the players'
      perspectives is that the *Tal'Kyr* is devoid of *Vaankara* crew, and should
      the plan go awry, is perfectly capable of acting like a massive lifeboat
      for the away team.


      Unfortunately, the docking clamps are locked shut, and will need to be cut in
      order to free the vessel. Further complicating things, the *Tal'Kyr* is meant
      to be launched with the Warp Nacelle stowed in the horizontal position, a task
      that is not possible while at warp. The support vessel will need to be
      carefully piloted to thread it between the nacelle and the ship's hull. This
      can be made slightly easier by partially rotating the nacelle out of the way
      (which risks dangerous stresses on the hull), or by scanning ahead to find
      a window of clear space where the *Vaankara* is not likely to encounter
      turbulence or inteference (requiring access to the ship's sensors from the
      bridge).


      As suggested above, this is a relatively safe way for the away team to de-warp
      the *Vaankara*, and it is its own backup plan, as the *Tal'Kyr* can act as a
      lifeboat should something go wrong. Still, there is always a risk that the
      *Vaankara*'s warp field does not collapse quickly (shaking the ship apart) or
      at all (in which case the vessel would continue on it's path unimpeded). In
      the latter case, the *Tal'Kyr*'s weapons might allow for a shot or two, and if
      done at point-blank range should be enough to destroy the ship.
  -
    Subtitle: Unscramble the Navigational Controls
    Text: >-
      It will take quite the feat to unscramble the navigational subroutines and
      regain control of the ship's heading, but it might be possible with the right
      set of away team members. Direct access to the computer core is required, and
      the crew will need to secure the Bridge in order to man the helm.


      Reprogramming the computer core is nothing short of a small miracle, and it is
      entirely possible that the away team will need to switch to an alternative
      method, having wasted precious time.
  -
    Subtitle: Eject Antimatter Pods
    Text: >-
      Ejecting the antimatter pods is a less controlled form of reducing the warp
      reactor's power output by suddenly depriving it of reactants. Without a gentle
      decrease in power, the warp field will collapse very suddenly. The away team
      should ensure that the structural integrity of the ship is boosted as much
      as possible, preferrably by locating and reinforcing additional structural
      weakpoints.
  -
    separate: True
    Title: Navigating Around the *Vaankara*
    Text: >-
      Moving between compartments is likely to be fraught with danger. The *Vaankara*
      crew will attack the away team on sight, and the various environmental hazards
      should provide quite the challenge for players.


      To simulate the difficulty involved in traversing the ship, players should
      encounter about one or two hazards whenever they transfer between regions of
      the ship. If the traversal is short enough or the path has already been
      traversed, the hazards should be skipped to prevent burnout from the players.
      

      The GM can make the journey more dynamic by presenting a choice of hazards the
      away team can face. 

      
      For example, the path from the Bridge to Main Engineering could be done either
      via the turbolifts and corridors, or via jefferies tube. The former is more
      likely to attract the attention of the *Vaankara* crew, and face atmospheric
      hazards like pressure differentials or flooded compartments. The latter path,
      via jefferies tubes, is less likely to encounter the crew, but significantly
      more likely to face energy hazards, especially plasma fires and electrical
      discharges.
      

      The choices need not be mutually exclusive, and can allow for a backup option
      should the chosen method fail to provide safe passage. A journey that begun via
      the turbolifts could quickly require a trek through jefferies tubes if the
      lift becomes stuck between decks.


      Additionally, players should be given the option to change their minds once
      they are presented with a specific hazard. Away teams can and often need to
      backtrack and find an alternate route in unknown environments, and flexibility
      and adaptability to changing conditions is a mark of a good officer.

    Title: Securing a Main Compartment
    Text: >-
      As the [Vaankara main compartments section](#vaankara-main-compartments) shows,
      many of the mission critical compartments are inaccessible to the away team upon
      beaming in. None of these hazards are meant to be impossible to correct, but they
      will require some degree of ingenuity and luck to come up with a solution.


      For example, suppose that the away team wishes to clear out the drive coolant
      preventing them from accessing Main Engineering.


      They could attempt to override the security lockout at the computer terminal by
      the entrance (Extended **Control + Security** Task, Difficulty of 2, Work Track
      of 12, 2 Breakthroughs required, Resistance of 2) to vent the compartment,
      where they would be exposed and come under attack by the *Vaankara* crew while
      they work.


      Alternatively, they could attempt to access the environmental controls for Main
      Engineering inside a jefferies tube, the entrance of which has a plasma fire
      that must be put out (**Daring + Security** Difficulty 4, Complication on 17+).


      In either event, clearing out the environmental hazard does not necessarily
      secure the compartment. The *Vaankara* crew may notice the away team's activity
      and mount an attack. Despite their psychosis, the crew have not lost their
      intelligence, and are perfectly capable of using the *Vaankara*'s systems
      against the away team. For example, they could release a toxic substance through
      the ventillation system, or they could attempt to overload a nearby EPS conduit
      to blow a hole through the bulkhead, allowing them access into the compartment.


      As a rule of thumb, the players should feel a constant pressure to move on and
      avoid staying in any one location for too long. A lone crewmember might discover
      them within minutes, and create enough of a ruckus to attract several others,
      which can quickly outnumber and overwhelm the away team.

    Title: Introduction
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Captain's Log: Stardate 2161.8"

          Four hours ago, Starfleet received an emergency request from the Vulcan
          High Council, requesting that the *Endeavour* be immediately dispatched
          to the nearby Gamma Hydrae system along the disputed Romulan Border. A
          Tellarite deep-space survey vessel picked up the *Vaankara*, a Vulcan
          vessel lost in the Delphic Expanse four years ago, on long range sensors
          seemingly heading directly for Romulan Space at approximately Warp 5.8. All
          attempts to contact the *Vaankara* were unsuccessful, though given the
          ship's final transmission that is perhaps to be expected.


          The Tellarite ship was unable to catch up to the *Vaankara*, but
          fortunately the captain was able to determine the ship's approximate
          heading before it disappeared from their sensor range. Based on the
          Vulcan's best estimates, the *Vaankara* will pass by the Cheron system in
          about ten days, where the Romulan Star Empire has established a colony just
          outside Coalition sensor range.


          Whatever the reason for the *Vaankara*'s mysterious heading, the Romulans
          are sure to consider even a minor breach of their borders an act of
          aggression. To have a Vulcan vessel pass by one of their colonies could
          pull Vulcan and the Coalition into a pointless war. It is our mission to
          ensure that the sovereignty of the Empire's borders is respected. The
          *Endeavour* is to set an intercept course that will bring us within
          transporter range of the *Vaankara* as it passes through Gamma Hydrae.
          Though we will be unable to maintain speed with the Vulcan ship for long,
          my engineer assures me the *Endeavour* can sustain Warp 5.8 for no less
          than 90 seconds, just enough time to beam aboard an away team.


          It will be up to them to disable the *Vaankara*'s warp drive, or failing
          that, activate the ship's self-destruct and eject in one of the escape pods
          before it crosses into Romulan space approximately four hours after our
          intercept. A Vulcan salvage vessel is scheduled to rendezvous with us
          within 48 hours. Should the away team succeed in safely stopping the
          *Vaankara*, they will take over the somber task of finally laying this
          ghost ship to rest.

    separate: True
    Subtitle: Scene 1
    Title: Intercept with the *Vaankara*
    Text: >-
      The *Vaankara* appears at extreme sensor range approximately 30 seconds before
      the *Endeavour* accelerates to Warp 5.8, a speed it can only hold for an
      extremely short period of time without suffering catastrophic damage to its
      engines.

      
      The away team should already be at the transporter pad. Up to six (6) crew
      members can transport in a single cycle. If there are fewer than six players,
      they may choose additional members of the crew (NPCs or supporting characters)
      to accompany them, at the cost of one (1) **Crew Support** per character. A
      player may switch to control one of these additional crew members at the start
      of a scene for free, but cannot use **Crew Support** to bring in additional
      characters that did not transport over. If there are more than six (6) players,
      you may rationalize the greater transport capacity as a volumetric transport
      rather than an entity-transport, but increase the complication range for the
      transport Task by two (2) as the *Endeavour*'s transporter is not meant to
      transport humans in that mode.


      Players should have access to the Vulcan Database, which will enable them to
      select a suitable beam in location. They may be tempted to choose an obvious
      compartment, like the Bridge or Main Engineering, but those compartments have
      highly hazardous environments that will necessitate an immediate evacuation
      (see [the *Vaankara* compartment table](#vsa-vaankara)). A **Reason + Science
      or Medicine** Task assissted by the ship's **Sensors + Science** with a
      Difficulty of 1 will reveal that major portions of the ship are badly damaged
      and all critical areas of the ship show hazardous conditions. For each Momentum
      spent to Obtain Information, the players can get information about one
      compartment or zone aboard the *Vaankara* from the [the *Vaankara* compartment
      table](#vsa-vaankara). Note that the crewmembers should *not* be recognized
      by the sensors as Vulcan, but should read as indeterminate humanoid life-forms.


      As soon as the *Vaankara* enters the transporter window, the away team is on a
      timer to complete the transport. The window will last just 90 seconds, and the
      transporter takes at least 30 seconds to cycle. The Transporter Task is a
      **Control + Engineering** Task with a Difficulty of 2 and a Complication Range
      of 17+, assisted by the ship's **Sensors + Engineering**. This takes into
      account the +1 Difficulty increase due to the *Vaankara*'s non-functional
      Transporter Pad, and the -1 Difficulty decrease from performing the Task from
      the Transporter Room. The Transporter Task can Succeed at a Cost.


      ??? failure "Transporter Complications"

          - The away team beams aboard the wrong location in the *Vaankara*.
          
              - Good locations include the Mess Hall, Shuttle Bay, Crew Quarters, Cargo
              Bays, or anywhere else that is far from the Bridge or Engineering.
            
          - The away team is transported to different locations aboard the *Vaankara*.
          
              - Consider putting the crew on separate decks, or possibly across two
              sides of a bulkhead or jefferies tube.

          - The away team's equipment is damaged in the transport, the result of an
          automatic safety feature in the pattern buffer in order to protect the
          organic matter from losing integrity.

          - The away team beams into a breached corridor, sealed off from the rest
          of the ship by emergency bulkheads. They must venture outside to find
          another entry point.

          - The beam-in causes a power surge in the *Vaankara*'s EPS grid that begins
          flooding the compartment with radiation, forcing the away team to abandon any
          large equipment or spare parts they may have brought in order to reach
          a safe zone.

      Aside from the optional *Plot an Intercept with the Vaankara*, all Tasks
      should be able to Succeed at a Cost. Non-optional failed Tasks should increase
      the Difficulty of the next Task downwards in the sequence. For example, *Close

      the Difficulty of *Set the Transporter to Automatic Cycle* if failed.
      
      
      If too many Tasks are failed, it is possible that the ship is unable to maintain
      distance with the *Vaankara*. This could lead to a new set of Engineering-related
      Tasks in order to squeeze additional speed out of the engines to allow a second
      attempt.
      
      
      Ultimately, if too many Tasks are failed, it may come to pass that the crew
      has no other option but to abandon the boarding plan and proceed with the
      destruction of the *Vaankara*. Though not an positive outcome, as the
      destruction of the ship could result in [severe consequences for both the
      player characters specifically and Starfleet in
      general](#why-not-simply-destroy-the-vaankara), the crew did make their best

    Title: Aboard the *Vaankara*
    Text: >-
      Once aboard, the away team will receive a signal from the *Endeavour* that it
      has reduced speed to the safe maximum of Warp 5.4. From this moment on, the
      away team is on its own and must complete the mission, otherwise they are sure
      to be captured or killed by the Romulans upon entering their territory.
          
      
      The *Vaankara* is in a terrible state. Every compartment has some problem,
      ranging from lack of artificial gravity to drive plasma leaks to extreme
      temperature variations. The player characters will need to stay in their EV
      suits throughout their mission, at least until they can secure and repair some
      compartment of the ship.


      An environmental scan of the *Vaankara*, using a **Reason + Medicine** Task
      with Difficulty 1, reveals that the atmosphere (where it exists) is heavily
      contaminated with Trellium-D, a material known to protect against the effects
      of the spatial anomalies found in the Delphic Expanse.


      Additional information may be obtained by spending Momentum.
      

      - Several clusters of organic matter consistent with Vulcan corpses are
      detected on the scan, though the readings are unclear as to exactly how many
      bodies given the state of decomposition. Some of the clusters appear to be
      *moving*, though the readings are highly distorted, so it is possible that it
      is a sensor ghost.

      - The *Vaankara*'s atmosphere contains large quantities of organic volatiles
      consistent with organic acids and solvents. Several compartments show damage to
      the bulkheads where these compounds have eaten away at the duranium alloys
      favored by Vulcan construction.
      
      
      - Many of the walls have splatters consistent with sprays from blunt impacts.
      The splatters are old and dried out, but unmistakably rich in copper compounds
      typically found in Vulcanoid blood. The scans show trace amounts of the same
      organic acids and solvents, though in such minute quantities as to possibly be
      due to cross contamination over the years.


      As the *Enterprise* discovered, Trellium-D is extremely toxic to Vulcanoids,
      even brief exposure to minute quantities can lead to serious neurological
      damage. With the quantities found aboard the *Vaankara*, it's obvious that the
      crew would have quickly succumbed to Trellium induced psychosis and murdered
      each other.


      Unbeknownst to the players, the crew on the *Vaankara* is not entirely dead. Of
      an original crew complement of 147, there are 53 who did not perish in the
      outbreak of rage and violence that marked the ship's last transmission. Those
      so-called survivors have become shuffling husks completely devoid of any
      semblance of humanity. They are the *Ghosts of the Vaankara*, and they are
      consumed by an unquenchable rage.


      Depending on where the away team beamed-in, it is possible that the putrid,
      dismembered bodies of the *Vaankara*'s crew can be found in the same compartment.
      A **Reason + Medicine** Task with Difficulty 1 will show that they died from
      injuries sustained during an all-out brawl. It is clear that the violence did
      not stop with their deaths, as all the corpses show signs of post-mortem
      dismemberment and even cannibalism.

      The following tables contain sample complications for compartments aboard the 
      *Vaankara*. Related effects are listed according to lethality.

      
      Unless otherwise specified, damage effects are either continuous (Difficulty
      or Complication Range increases), or attacks done once a Round at the *start*
      of a Round (ex: `3 dC` would be an environmental effect dealing 3 Challenge
      Dice of non-lethal damage to all affected characters).


      Note that all damage values are recommendations, and can be changed to suit the
      desired danger presented by the compartment. 


      Additionally, although not listed, each hazard could increase the Difficulty
      and/or Complication Range of some or all Tasks. It is up to the GM to determine
      which Tasks may or may not be affected. As a rule of thumb, if the Task
      directly depends on an environmental factor, increase the Difficulty (ex:
      scanning in a radiation field). If the task is more dangerous due to the
      environment, increase Complication Range (ex: ranged combat in a smoky
      environment). A hazard may even make a Task impossible (ex: lighting a fire
      in a vacuum).

              containers or possibly evolved from decomposing matter. EV Suits should
              protect against this hazard.

            - Burst Fluid Pipe (Inert Fluid)
            - +1 or +2 Difficulty to Tasks
            - >-
              A ruptured water, sewage, or other inert fluid pipe can quickly fill a
              sealed compartment, and can knock down people with the force of the
              escaping fluid. EV Suits can protect against choking or drowning, but
              they do very little against the difficulty of moving around or trying to
              perform repairs as the compartment floods.

            - Fire
            - 4 dC, Vicious 1
            - >-
              Fire aboard a starship is normally suppressed automatically, but the
              *Vaankara*'s systems have long since run dry. Entire compartments have
              been reduced to ash, and it only takes a small electrical short or
              plasma discharge to start a conflagration.
          -
            - High Toxicity Gasses
            - 5 dC, Debilitating, possibly Lethal
            - >-
              Leaking plasma coolant or other highly corrosive, toxic, or reactive
              gas has filled the compartment. EV Suits can protect against some of
              these hazards, but prolonged exposure (minutes) may corrode the seals
              and allow the hazardous atmosphere to leak into the suit, depending on
              the concentration.
          -
            - Pressure Differential
            - 4 dC, Knockdown, Area
            - >-
              The sudden equalization of pressure acts like a bomb, throwing players
              around and slamming them into the deck plating or a bulkhead. The
              damage is dealt only once, as the pressure is equalized.
          - 
            - Explosive Fuel/Air Mixture
            - (On Explosion) 4 to 8 dC, Area, Vicious 1
            - >-
              A hydrogen line or other volatile fluid pipe can quickly fill a room
              with an explosive mixture of oxygen and fumes. Some mixtures can
              spontaneously detonate, while others require a source of energy (such
              as a spark, exposed flame, or energy weapon discharge) to ignire.
          -
            - Hard Vacuum
            - >-
              30s: Nonlethal Injury, 60s: Lethal Injury
            - >-
              The compartment has already been breached to space. Players have a
              limited period of useful activity before succumbing to the effects of
              vacuum. EV Suits negate the injury effects. The vacuum could make
              certain Tasks harder, increase their Complication Range, or outright
              make them impossible.
          -
            - Decompression Hazard
            - Lethal
            - >-
              The compartment's structural integrity has been critically compromised,
              threatening to explosively decompress at any moment. Starfleet protocols
              prohibit entry into such a compartment under any circumstances, as not
              even magnetic boots will not prevent a person from being ejected into
              space. On the *Vaankara*, this can easily result in the character being
              lost to the depths of space, never to be found again.
