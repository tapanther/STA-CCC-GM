  Description: >-
    The *Vaankara*, Vulcan spaceship long-thought lost to the Delphic Expanse
    re-appears on long-range sensors traveling at high warp towards a Romulan colony.
    All attempts to contact the vessel have failed, though that is to be expected as
    the Vulcan High Command had received a transmission from the *Vaankara* showing
    the crew killing each other violently as a result of Trellium-D induced
    psychosis. The ship is travelling slightly too fast for the Endeavour's Warp Five
    engine to keep up with, but it should be possible to match velocities just long
    enough for a small away team to transport aboard and shut down the *Vaankara*'s
    warp engines before it crosses into Romulan territory.

    Title: Why Not Simply Destroy the *Vaankara*?
    Text: >-
      Some players may wonder why they shouldn't simply destroy or disable the
      *Vaankara* after closing within weapons range. While this would effectively
      solve the core issue of violating Romulan Space, this is effectively the
      quickest way to a "Bad Ending" for this mission. The *Vaankara* is extremely
      damaged, and it is unlikely to be able to withstand any additional weapons
      fire. Indeed, the ship's Structure is a single breach from complete destruction,
      and as that is the most likely hit location, the risk is too great.

      
      Destroying the *Vaankara* without ensuring that there are in fact no survivors
      and without even an attempt to salvage the craft is certain to cause a
      political incident with the Vulcan High Council. Starfleet Command will not
      look kindly upon officers that shoot first and ask questions later, especially
      where Coalition allies are concerned. The players would find themselves court
      martialed for dereliction of duty at a minimum, possibly multiple counts of
      murder if the Vulcan salvage vessel finds the corpses of recently killed
      Vulcans amongst the wreckage.


      All of this information would be known by the players' characters, but the GM
      may need to remind players. It is not Starfleet's policy to open fire upon a
      defenseless vessel without cause, and Starfleet has no use for officers that
      feel otherwise.

    Title: Introduction
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Captain's Log: Stardate 2161.8"

          Four hours ago, Starfleet received an emergency request from the Vulcan
          High Council, requesting that the *Endeavour* be immediately dispatched
          to the nearby Gamma Hydrae system along the disputed Romulan Border. A
          Tellarite deep-space survey vessel picked up the *Vaankara*, a Vulcan
          vessel lost in the Delphic Expanse four years ago, on long range sensors
          seemingly heading directly for Romulan Space at approximately Warp 5.8. All
          attempts to contact the *Vaankara* were unsuccessful, though given the
          ship's final transmission that is perhaps to be expected.


          The Tellarite ship was unable to catch up to the *Vaankara*, but
          fortunately the captain was able to determine the ship's approximate
          heading before it disappeared from their sensor range. Based on the
          Vulcan's best estimates, the *Vaankara* will pass by the Cheron system in
          about ten days, where the Romulan Star Empire has established a colony just
          outside Coalition sensor range.


          Whatever the reason for the *Vaankara*'s mysterious heading, the Romulans
          are sure to consider even a minor breach of their borders an act of
          aggression. To have a Vulcan vessel pass by one of their colonies could
          pull Vulcan and the Coalition into a pointless war. It is our mission to
          ensure that the sovereignty of the Empire's borders is respected. The
          *Endeavour* is to set an intercept course that will bring us within
          transporter range of the *Vaankara* as it passes through Gamma Hydrae.
          Though we will be unable to maintain speed with the Vulcan ship for long,
          my engineer assures me the *Endeavour* can sustain Warp 5.8 for no less
          than 90 seconds, just enough time to beam aboard an away team.


          It will be up to them to disable the *Vaankara*'s warp drive, or failing
          that, activate the ship's self-destruct and eject in one of the escape pods
          before it crosses into Romulan space approximately four hours after our
          intercept. A Vulcan salvage vessel is scheduled to rendezvous with us
          within 48 hours. Should the away team succeed in safely stopping the
          *Vaankara*, they will take over the somber task of finally laying this
          ghost ship to rest.

    Title: Intercept with the *Vaankara*
    Text: >-
      The *Vaankara* appears at extreme sensor range approximately 30 seconds before
      the *Endeavour* accelerates to Warp 5.8, a speed it can only hold for an
      extremely short period of time without suffering catastrophic damage to its
      engines.

      
      The away team should already be at the transporter pad. Up to six (6) crew
      members can transport in a single cycle. If there are fewer than six players,
      they may choose additional members of the crew (NPCs or supporting characters)
      to accompany them, at the cost of one (1) **Crew Support** per character. A
      player may switch to control one of these additional crew members at the start
      of a scene for free, but cannot use **Crew Support** to bring in additional
      characters that did not transport over. If there are more than six (6) players,
      you may rationalize the greater transport capacity as a volumetric transport
      rather than an entity-transport, but increase the complication range for the
      transport Task by two (2) as the *Endeavour*'s transporter is not meant to
      transport humans in that mode.


      As soon as the *Vaankara* enters the transporter window, the away team is on a
      timer to complete the transport. The window will last just 90 seconds, and the
      transporter takes at least 30 seconds to cycle. The Transporter Task is a
      **Control + Engineering** Task with a Difficulty of 2 and a Complication Range
      of 17+, assisted by the ship's **Sensors + Engineering**. This takes into
      account the +1 Difficulty increase due to the *Vaankara*'s non-functional
      Transporter Pad, and the -1 Difficulty decrease from performing the Task from
      the Transporter Room. The Transporter Task can Succeed at a Cost.


      ??? failure "Transporter Complications"

          - The away team beams aboard the wrong location in the *Vaankara*.
          
              - Good locations include the Mess Hall, Shuttle Bay, Crew Quarters, Cargo
              Bays, or anywhere else that is far from the Bridge or Engineering.
            
          - The away team is transported to different locations aboard the *Vaankara*.
          
              - Consider putting the crew on separate decks, or possibly across two
              sides of a bulkhead or jefferies tube.

          - The away team's equipment is damaged in the transport, the result of an
          automatic safety feature in the pattern buffer in order to protect the
          organic matter from losing integrity.

          - The away team beams into a breached corridor, sealed off from the rest
          of the ship by emergency bulkheads. They must venture outside to find
          another entry point.

          - The beam-in causes a power surge in the *Vaankara*'s EPS grid that begins
          flooding the compartment with radiation, forcing the away team to abandon any
          large equipment or spare parts they may have brought in order to reach
          a safe zone.

      Note that as it is critical that the away team make it aboard the *Vaankara*,
      it is strongly suggested that the Transporter Task be allowed to Succeed at a
      Cost. If a more dynamic introduction scene is desired, consider using a Gated
      Task for the beam-in.

      Aside from the optional *Plot an Intercept with the Vaankara*, all Tasks
      should be able to Succeed at a Cost. Non-optional failed Tasks should increase
      the Difficulty of the next Task downwards in the sequence. For example, *Close
      to Transporter Range* and *Locate a Suitable Beam-In Site* would both increase
      the Difficulty of *Set the Transporter to Automatic Cycle* if failed.
      
      
      If too many Tasks are failed, it is possible that the ship is unable to maintain
      distance with the *Vaankara*. This could lead to a new set of Engineering-related
      Tasks in order to squeeze additional speed out of the engines to allow a second
      attempt.
      
      
      Ultimately, if too many Tasks are failed, it may come to pass that the crew
      has no other option but to abandon the boarding plan and proceed with the
      destruction of the *Vaankara*. Though not an positive outcome, as the
      destruction of the ship could result in [severe consequences for both the
      player characters specifically and Starfleet in
      general](#why-not-simply-destroy-the-vaankara), the crew did make their best
      attempt to intercept and salvage the *Vaankara*, a fact that won't be lost on
      the Vulcans or Starfleet Command. 
      
      
      If the attempt to board the *Vaankara* fails, consider playing out the court
      martial.

    Subtitle: GM Guide to the *Vaankara*
    Title: VSA Vaankara
    Text: >-
      The *Vaankara* is a *D'Kyr*-Class, a multi-purpose cruiser more typically
      suited to combat operations than scientific or exploratory missions, though
      given the superior level of Vulcan technology *D'Kyr*-Class' scientific
      facilities easily rival the *NX*-Class'.


      The *Vaankara* is composed a flattened, conical hull that flares out around a
      circular warp nacelle at the aft section. The circular nacelle can be rotated
      into the plane of the primary hull for combat. A detachable *Tal'Kyr*
      warp-capable shuttle docks to a hull extension inside the circular warp
      nacelle. The vessel consists of thirteen (13) decks. The table below contains
      a non-exhaustive list of major compartments and their approximate locations on
      the vessel.

      
      !!! note "Vessel Coordinates"

          While `deck` is well understood as the Y-axis measure for a ship, there
          hasn't been a clear way to refer to the X and Z positions. `Bulkhead` and
          `Section` are sometimes used, albeit inconsistently. For this and other
          missions, the recommended scheme is as follows:

            - **Deck** : Typical usage. Deck 1 is the highest deck, with increasing
              numbers descending through the ship. A compartment that spans multiple
              decks uses the lowest deck. For example, Main Engineering aboard an
              *NX*-Class vessel spans Decks D and E, so it would be labeled as Deck
              E.

            - **Frame** : A vertical plane, aligned with the 'ribs' of the ship, that
              describes the position of a compartment from fore to aft. Frame 1 is
              the foremost position, with increasing numbers aftward through the
              ship. The foremost bulkhead of a compartment defines the frame number.
              For example, a compartment spanning across Frames 10, 11, 12 would bear
              frame number 10.

            - **Section** : A vertical plane perpendicular to the 'ribs' of the ship
              which describes the distance from the centerline. Compartments that
              span the centerline have Section 0. Compartments completely port of the
              centerline have even section numbers (2, 4, 6), while compartments
              starboard of the centerline have odd section numbers (1, 3, 5).
              Increasing numbers denote a greater distance from the centerline,
              matching the 'runners' on the ship's keel. The center-most section
              number is used. For example, Main Engineering on an *NX*-Class vessel
              would use Section 0, as it spans the center, while the Captain's Ready
              Room would have Section 1, as it lies entirely to starboard of the
              centerline.

            - **Usage** : One capital letter denoting the primary use of the
              compartment. The following table is borrowed heavily from the
              Naval equivalents.

              ```

              +---+----------------------------------------------+
              ```

          This scheme is basically the same one used aboard naval vessesls, and is
          relatively easy to parse for comparative purposes. For example, if players
          are in a compartment labeled `E-120-4` and need to travel to another
          labeled `D-100-5`, they would know to ascend one deck (E to D), head
          forward (120 is aft of 100), and cross over to the starboard side of the
          centerline (4 is even and therefore port, 5 is the equivalent section to
          starboard).

    Text: >-
      Once aboard, the away team will receive a signal from the *Endeavour* that it
      has reduced speed to the safe maximum of Warp 5.4. From this moment on, the
      away team is on its own and must complete the mission, otherwise they are sure
      to be captured or killed by the Romulans upon entering their territory.
          
      
      The *Vaankara* is in a terrible state. Every compartment has some problem,
      ranging from lack of artificial gravity to drive plasma leaks to extreme
      temperature variations. The player characters will need to stay in their EV
      suits throughout their mission, at least until they can secure and repair some
      compartment of the ship.


      An environmental scan of the *Vaankara*, using a **Reason + Medicine** Task
      with Difficulty 1, reveals that the atmosphere (where it exists) is heavily
      contaminated with Trellium-D, a material known to protect against the effects
      of the spatial anomalies found in the Delphic Expanse.


      Additional information may be obtained by spending Momentum.
      

      - Several clusters of organic matter consistent with Vulcan corpses are
      detected on the scan, though the readings are unclear as to exactly how many
      bodies given the state of decomposition. Some of the clusters appear to be
      *moving*, though the readings are highly distorted, so it is possible that it
      is a sensor ghost.

      - The *Vaankara*'s atmosphere contains large quantities of organic volatiles
      consistent with organic acids and solvents. Several compartments show damage to
      the bulkheads where these compounds have eaten away at the duranium alloys
      favored by Vulcan construction.
      
      
      - Many of the walls have splatters consistent with sprays from blunt impacts.
      The splatters are old and dried out, but unmistakably rich in copper compounds
      typically found in Vulcanoid blood. The scans show trace amounts of the same
      organic acids and solvents, though in such minute quantities as to possibly be
      due to cross contamination over the years.


      As the *Enterprise* discovered, Trellium-D is extremely toxic to Vulcanoids,
      even brief exposure to minute quantities can lead to serious neurological
      damage. With the quantities found aboard the *Vaankara*, it's obvious that the
      crew would have quickly succumbed to Trellium induced psychosis and murdered
      each other.


      Unbeknownst to the players, the crew on the *Vaankara* is not entirely dead. Of
      an original crew complement of 147, there are 41 who did not perish in the
      outbreak of rage and violence that marked the ship's last transmission. Those
      so-called survivors have become shuffling husks completely devoid of any
      semblance of humanity. They are the *Ghosts of the Vaankara*, and they are
      consumed by an unquenchable rage.


      Depending on where the away team beamed-in, it is possible that the putrid,
      dismembered bodies of the *Vaankara*'s crew can be found in the same compartment.
      A **Reason + Medicine** Task with Difficulty 1 will show that they died from
      injuries sustained during an all-out brawl. It is clear that the violence did
      not stop with their deaths, as all the corpses show signs of post-mortem
      dismemberment and even cannibalism.
