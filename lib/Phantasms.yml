  Description: >-
    The ship experiences a series of mysterious system failures and unlikely intruder
    reports as it races against time to deliver a group of refugees.


    Due to the ongoing war, the *Endeavour* is expected back at the front within 48
    hours. The ship will require 12 hours at Starbase 4 in order to disembark the
    refugees and resupply. The ship is currently 8 hours away from the starbase.


    At first, the time limit should not feel remotely onerous, as there are a spare
    36 hours between the ship's scheduled arrival and the necessary time to disembark
    and resupply. Partway into the mission however, the ship will experience a full
    loss of warp capabilities, suddenly putting the crew in a race against the clock.


    Unbeknownst to the crew, a small alien creature being sold as a pet by a stowaway
    merchant has escaped and is running around loose in the ship. At first the
    creature was harmless, but as it chews through the ship's ODN network and uses
    its hallucination-inducing powers to evade perceived threats, the crew will be
    left wondering if the entire thing is a matter or unfortunate coincidence or a
    deliberate (if somewhat strange) attempt at sabotage.


    A time tracker should be set up to help the players visualize the amount of time
    remaining in the mission, along with key events. Major undertakings should cost
    increments of time and be denoted on the time tracker appropriately. For example,
    the *Arrival at Starbase 4* event should be placed at `T + 8 Hr` at the start of
    the mission. A four hour task started at `T + 2 Hr` should be placed at `T + 6
    Hr`, and so on.


    The recommended time interval for the tracker is two hours. Trivial tasks
    (inspect a single hatch, scan a single room) can be done at no time cost, while
    longer tasks should take one or more two-hour increments (a quick security sweep
    of one deck can take four hours, a full security sweep of one deck can take
    twelve hours). Tasks that will reveal critical information about the creature
    (ex: laboratory work of saliva/urine samples, etc.) should take one or more
    time intervals before the results are available.


    Each time interval can hold one or more scenes (though one is suggested). When all
    outstanding tasks for that interval are done (and new tasks scheduled to complete at
    a future time), the GM can move time forward to the next scheduled event and start
    a new scene. Major GM-introduced events should be scheduled secretly.

    Title: Opening Log Entry
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Captain's Log: Stardate 2156.12"

          Following the surprise attack upon our colonies by the Romulan Star Empire,
          the *Endeavour* is enroute to Starbase 4 to drop off some hundred-fifty-odd
          refugees picked up from installations around the Gamma Hydrae System. We
          expect to arrive in approximately 8 hours. Needless to say, the crew is
          anxious to get their own quarters back after doubling up for the past few
          days.
          

          Aside from a few electrical anomalies over the past few hours, the journey
          has been uneventful. The Romulans appear to be focused on securing the
          territory they've captured, though Starfleet Command expects a new Romulan
          assault within the next few days. For this reason, it is imperative that
          the *Endeavour* be ready to depart Starbase 4 within 48 hours. Since it
          will only take 12 of those hours to resupply the *Endeavour* and disembark
          our passengers, there shouldn't be any issues.

    Subtitle: The Thritsian Mind Weasel
    Text: >-
      A small rodent-like creature from the far reaches of the quadrant, the
      Thritsian Mind Weasel is a shy, omnivorous creature not unlike an earth ferret.
      Gifted with an intense curiosity, a penchant for mischief, and instinctual
      psychic abilities that directly target the fear center of the brain, the
      Thritsian Mind Weasel is perfectly capable of wreaking unintentional havoc
      aboard a high-strung starship.


      The weasel was brought aboard by Richard Jollie, a stowed away smuggler and
      swindler. The small rodent escaped Mr. Jollie's coat, leaving a noticeable hole
      in the pocket where it was kept.


      The weasel is too small to be reliably picked up by internal scanners, which
      are just as likely to report any of the other missing pets. Further
      complicating matters, the creature is of unknown origin and species, as it
      comes from a world yet unknown to Starfleet, and the Vulcan Database does not
      contain a full genetic makeup of non-sentient species. The rodent should make
      it's presence known by a series of stolen items, strange system failures caused
      by its attempts to snack on the ODN network of the ship, and the occasional
      hallucination by a crewmember or refugee, which often takes the shape of a
      threatening or mysterious figure that compels the victim to divert all attention
      away from the small, scurrying pink fluffball racing across the deck.


      With sufficient samples and time, hand scanners may be able to pick up the
      creature reliably, eventually locating it hidden away in some jefferies tube
      or other remote location where it has started to nest. The nest will contain
      any and all stolen items.

    Subtitle: Intruder Alert in the Cargo Bay
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Intruder Alert!"

          Cargo Bay 1 to Bridge, Intruder Alert! Unknown figure just took off towards
          the Transporter Room after attempting to access an environmental
          maintenance panel. Requesting security teams be dispatched.


      Ensign Tavish Zemke, a junior planetary scientist reassigned to keep an eye out
      on the refugees in Cargo Bay 1 (Deck D, Starboard) reports seeing a humanoid
      figure bent over an open environmental control maintenance panel. He did not
      get a good look at the figure before it took off. The rest of the refugees have
      mixed accounts, some reporting seeing a figure of wildly variable descriptions
      while the rest deny seeing anyone. The Transporter Room will report nothing out
      of the ordinary, and a life signs scan reveals no unexpected life signs, though
      it is possible the intruder escaped detection by hiding among other refugees or
      switching decks before the crew could react.


      An inspection of the indicated environmental control panel reveals some light
      scratching on the *inside* of the hatch cover, as well as frayed ODN (fiber
      optic) strands. They appear to have been cut with a relatively blunt instrument,
      and may show unidentified organic traces when scanned. Processing the organic
      samples reveals it to be saliva.

          Bridge, Crewman Nakada reporting a suspicious person leaving the MACO
          training facility. What should I do?


      Crewman Hiro Nakada spotted a humanoid alien leaving the MACO Training Room on
      Deck F. He believes the figure could be Klingon, judging by the armor and
      stature, but the figure manages to turn the next corner every time Nakada
      manages to catch up. No anomalous life signs will be reported, with Crewman
      Nakada the only one in the corridors. If pressed, the Crewman will stress their
      certainty at having seen a figure.


      Inspecting the MACO training room will reveal that the compartment doors are
      faulty, opening and closing by themselves randomly, due to an intermittent
      short circuit caused by more frayed ODN fibers.

      ship's scheduled arrival.

      
      !!! quote "That's Strange..."

          Bridge, Engineering. Can we reduce speed to Warp 4.4? I'm picking up a
          variance in the Warp Field Governor, I'd like to run a Level 2 diagnostic
          but I can't do that at our current speed.


      Moments after the engineering report, the Helm will report that the warp factor
      is dropping at an accelerated rate (*"Warp 4.4, 4.2, 4.0, 3.6, 3.2, Warp 2,
      Warp 1"*) before the entire ship lurches forward as it drops out of warp.


      !!! quote "We Have a Problem..."

          Bridge, the Warp Field Governor is offline! I'm seeing a complete system
          failure, including the auxiliaries. I had to take the reactor offline to
          prevent spreading us across several parsecs.


      A thorough inspection of the governor will reveal that the Plasma Regulator
      Manifold Control Logic Board has been ripped out of it's socket. While a new
      control board can be fabricated, it will take at least three days to
      manufacture and calibrate the replacement.


      Unless the original can be found, the Endeavour will miss its deadline by days.
      Remove the *Arrival at Starbase 4* event from the tracker. Add the *Latest
      On-Time Arrival at Starbase 4* event to the tracker at the `T + 24 Hr` mark. If
      this timed event is passed, the mission is a failure, as the *Endeavour* will
      fail to reach its destination in time. Note that this is not necessarily the
      end of the mission, as now the main task is to minimize additional delay.


      The control board was indeed stolen by the errant would-be pet, as it has
      a strange affinity for hoarding random items. Once the creature is found, the
      control board will be among the creature's hoard.

    Subtitle: Lax Security Measures
    Text: >-
      Thorough inspections of any Deck or Compartment will reveal improperly secured
      maintenance hatches, unsealed jefferies tube access shafts, left behind
      equipment, and a general lax attitude towards typical security measures. Any of
      these could serve as potential sabotage points or provide escape routes for the
      reported intruders. Of particular note, some of these maintenance hatches may
      show signs of ODN damage caused by the missing rodent, or may have organic
      residues left behind (saliva, hair follicles, urine, etc.) consistent with the
      rodent's presence.

    Subtitle: Missing Weapons
    Text: >-
      Should a full inventory of the ship's small arms lockers and armory be
      undertaken, the quartermaster (Minerva Voight) will issue an alarm, reporting 5
      Phase Pistols, 2 Detonator Caps (for demolition explosives), and 1 MACO Plasma
      Rifle missing from the ship's stores. The detonator caps are especially
      worrying, as they could be used to detonate or damage far more lethal targets,
      including the ship's photonic torpedoes or antimatter storage pods.


      The inventory logs do not match with the manual inspection, though it is
      unclear when these weapons disappeared, as the last full inventory was conducted
      over two weeks ago, and security personnel access the small arms lockers on a
      daily basis.


      Given the various intruder reports, as well as the quartermaster's own
      suspicious nature, these discrepancies should appear to have been deliberate
      thefts. In reality, these inventory discrepancies are simply the result of poor
      record keeping, as the weapons were left behind or misplaced during various
      missions throughout the evacuation.

    Subtitle: Missing Items
    Text: >-
      In addition to the Warp Field Governor's control board, the rodent has stolen a
      variety of items from around the ship. There should be no rhyme or reason to
      the stolen items, though likely candidates for theft include hypospray
      cartridges from Sickbay, rank insignia from various officers, family mementos
      from crew and refugees, ODN repeaters (leading to minor system failures and
      engineering anomalies), and other small items that might attract the attention
      of the creature.

    Subtitle: Missing Persons and Pets
    Text: >-
      As the evacuations were chaotic, there is not a clear manifest of who and what
      exactly made it onboard. Rough lists were compiled, giving an approximate count
      of 152 refugees and dozens of cherished pets, but the lists are inaccurate and
      contradictory. With the refugees distributed throughout quarters and cargo bays
      and restricted to their temporary accommodations, there have been several
      reports of missing persons (who may have been routed to different ships or
      gotten separated in the chaos) and animals (often small creatures taken out of
      their enclosures by well-meaning children).

      Richard Parker Jollie (*"Founder, CEO, and President of the Jolly Trading and
      Curiosities Emporium, Limited"* as he will introduce his one-man smuggling
      operation), a silver-tongued independent trader and sometimes-swindler hiding
      out aboard Shuttlepod One.


      Mr. Jollie snuck into the launch bay during the chaos of the evacuation (*"I've
      done the math! There's not enough escape pods and shuttle pods for everyone
      onboard, so this is officially the safest place to be. After all, you wouldn't
      throw a poor, pitiful man out if he happened to already be aboard... You
      wouldn't!"*), taking several of his knick knacks and curiosities with him, one
      of which was the Thritsian mind weasel that escaped from his coat.

    Title: Conclusion
    Text: >-
      If the crew manages to find the Thritsian mind weasel with enough time to
      arrive at Starbase 4 before the deadline, the mission is a complete success.


      The difficulty of achieving this however is entirely up to the GM, who can
      provide as much or as little bonus information along the way to adjust for
      player progress. For example, if the crew fails to investigate hatches or find
      evidence of the rodent, a crew member might report having seen a small furry
      creature scurrying about before being attacked by a hallucinated assailant. If
      the crew immediately picks up on the rodent's existence, the furry creature
      could remain out of sight, with only the occasional hallucination popping up.


      The hallucinations provide an excellent distraction for the players, as they
      may need to reassure panic-gripped refugees that there are no alien raiders
      aboard, and could lead to fights (or even riots) breaking up as disjoint groups
      of refugees blame each other for stolen items or hallucinated attacks.
