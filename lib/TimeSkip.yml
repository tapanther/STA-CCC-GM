  Description: >-
    An experiment gone wrong abord the Vulcan Science Directorate's T'shannaik
    Stellar Laboratory leads the *Endeavour* crew to a Vulcan/Andorian border system to
    render assistance. The Laboratory was conducting a series of high-energy temporal
    mechanics experiments, which results in the *Endeavour* bridge crew not only being
    thrown forward and backward within their timeline, but across multiple alternate
    realities as they try to unravel the station's mysteries and prevent their own
    demise.


    Unbeknownst to the players, their characters are experiencing a sequence of
    events out of order and across variations of parallel universes as a result of
    the strange radiation emanating from the crippled station resonating with the
    particles from an anti-radiation inoculation that only the player characters
    were able to receive *before* coming into range of the station. The effect cannot
    be reproduced, as once the chemicals have been exposed to the emanations they
    will rapidly decompose.


    The emissions from the station are causing spatio-temporal anomalies throughout
    the system. These anomalies cause alternate realities to *leak* into each other,
    often with lethal consequences. The players will need to reverse the experiment
    at the core of the laboratory to restore the boundaries between universes.

    Title: Vulcan Science Directorate T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory
    Text: >-
      !!! quote "Captain's Log: Stardate 2161.7"

          The *Endeavour* is responding to an automated distress signal from the
          Vulcan Science Directorate's T'shannaik Stellar Laboratory on the
          Vulcan-Andorian border. With the Vulcan Space Agency fleet still recovering
          from First Minister T'Pau's house-cleaning, Starfleet Command has ordered
          us to lend whatever assistance the laboratory requires until a Vulcan aid
          vessel can be dispatched. I have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive
          casualties, and our Chief Engineer is prepared to direct damage control
          teams should the station's structural integrity be compromised. Without any
          further information from the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for
          any contingency.


          Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from
          the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the
          readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer
          could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the
          *Endeavour*, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the
          recent rumblings along the Romulan border, Starfleet could use all the
          goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station; should my
          decision prove unwise, this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown
          nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all
          potential away team members be inoculated against a wide range of
          radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is
          performing the injections now.


          Computer, note the time and date in the ship's log. Mr. jav-Karst, please
          update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy.

    Title: All Hands Abandon Ship!
    Subtitle: Scene 5 (T + 8 Hours)
    Text: >-
      As the *Endeavour* prepares to drop out of warp, the crew feels a sudden lurch
      in their stomachs, as though the grav-plating has suddenly reversed polarity.

      
      !!! quote "The Shift"

          You feel a sudden lurch in your stomach, as though the grav-plating had
          suddenly reversed polarity. Your hearing and vision are filled with a
          maddening superposition of millions of ghostly echoes. It's as if someone
          had overlaid a thousand takes of a movie scene, all carrying out the same
          actions and speaking the same words, but each one just slightly out of sync
          with the rest. As the specters dissipate away, you find yourself disoriented
          and carrying a profound sense of estrangement.


      The sensation is momentary but it overwhelms all senses. In an instant, the
      situation around the players has changed completely. Whereas the ship was
      previously operating under 'All Clear' conditions, the crew find themselves
      rocked and thrown about their stations as explosions rock an already crippled
      ship. Tasks from this moment should be taken following combat ordering rules.


      All players should attempt a **Fitness + Security Task** with a Difficulty of
      2 to resist being flung from their station. Players who fail this Task are
      knocked prone, and will need to perform the *Change Position* Minor Task
      before they can perform any ship-related Task.


      A check of the ship's chronometer will reveal that the current time is 8 hours
      after the *Endeavour*'s arrival in the system. The main computer is severely
      damaged, and most basic data lookup functions, including personal or ship logs,
      are currently inaccessible, preventing the players from simply reading what has
      happened in those 8 hours. As the players look around the bridge, the sense of
      estrangement should only grow. Although this is clearly still the *Endeavour*,
      it is not *their Endeavour*. All of the Starfleet insignia are wrong, and the
      United Earth logos and inscriptions instead present themselves as the Earth
      Alliance.


      ![Earth Alliance Seal](img/Earth_Alliance_Seal.jpg)
      

      As the players represent the only members of the crew that received the
      doctor's inoculation in time, they are in the unique situation of finding
      themselves without any memories since dropping out of warp. As far as they
      are concerned the *Endeavour* was fine one moment and then it wasn't. Captain
      Winchester (NPC) was not among the inoculated, and orders all stations to
      provide a Damage Report unaware of what is going on with the players.


      !!! quote "Status Report"

          What in the name of hell is going on here! This was supposed to be a rescue
          operation, we're not equipped to take on that many ships, and certainly not
          after getting caught with our proverbial pants down. We can't take much
          more of this. Helm, do your best to make us as small a target as possible.
          All stations, damage report!


      Due to the massive amount of missing information, players must perform a
      **Control + Command** Task with a Difficulty of 0 in order to perform the
      Damage Report. Any attempt to question the Captain or the rest of the crew is
      met by a sharp rebuke and a direct order you carry out instructions.


      !!! quote "This is not the Time..."

          Save the questions for if we get out of this mess. I gave you an order,
          I expect you to carry it out or relieve yourself of duty! This is not
          the time to dawdle, people!

      Unbeknownst to the players, the *Endeavour* is currently under attack from an
      Andorian fleet from an alternate reality where the United Coalition of Planets
      never formed as the Enterprise failed to prevent a war between Vulcan and
      Andoria. Severely outnumbered by two dozen *Kumari-Class* vessels, the
      *Endeavour* will be destroyed 8 hours after arriving in the system if the
      players are unable to restore the walls between realities before then.


      The players will have a few rounds to gather information before the captain (or
      acting-captain) is forced to order all hands to abandon ship. As the order is
      given, emergency hatches throughout the ship are automatically deployed to give
      the crew access to the escape pods. A careful observer will note that there are
      not enough escape pods available, as several have become damaged or otherwise
      unreachable due to the ferocity of the attack.


      !!! quote "This is the Captain..."

          *This is the Captain, all-hands abandon ship! Repeat, all-hands
          abandon ship!*
      

      Whenever it happens, the order comes too late, as the antimatter storage pods
      fail catastrophically and destroy the *Endeavour*. Just as the bridge fills
      with a brilliant light, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs, as their
      consciousnesses are sent back in time to an earlier point.

      The players find themselves in EV Suits deep within a breached section of the
      station. The corridors are pitch black, the only lights are those coming from
      the group's helmet torches. The artificial gravity in this section has failed,
      and the suit's HUD indicates there is no breathable atmosphere.
      

      They are accompanied by a pair of figures in Vulcan-esque space suits, which
      bear the High Command's insignia. The EV suit HUD labels these figures as
      Subcommander V'Thena and Subaltern Skutt, both members of the Vulcan Security
      Forces, the V'Shar.

      !!! quote "T'Var's Warning"

          You should be approaching the air-gap now. The turbolifts are down, so you
          will need to descend carefully. Fortunately the security system is
          unpowered, otherwise your traversal would be significantly more difficult.
          Once you are inside the station core, you will need to reroute power to the
          station's communication channels, otherwise I will be unable to guide you
          further as the chamber is hardened against interference.


      If the players have questions for Subcommander V'Thena, they will find her
      quite dry and uninterested in conversation. The key detail they should gain is
      that the attack was sudden, unexpected, and unmotivated. Neither V'Thena nor
      the players know at this time that the Andorians attacking the station were
      uncontrolled leaks from another alternate reality. There is evidence, ranging
      from the strange uniforms and insignia, and data padds with references to the
      Andorian People's Army, presumably an unknown splinter faction with surprising
      organization, in reality an alternate reality faction at war with Vulcan.


      ??? info "What the Subcommander Knows"

          - Where are we?  
              - Vulcan High Command T'shuvath Stellar Laboratory
          - Why are we here?  
              - The *Endeavour* is responding to a distress signal from the
              Laboratory, which suddenly came under attack by the Andorian Empire. Though
              ostensibly neutral, Starfleet has de-facto sided with the High Command.
          - Why are we in this hallway?
              - The experiment running in the station's core must be shut down. T'Var
              has determined that the experiment is causing spatio-temporal anomalies
              that threaten any vessel in the area.
          - Where is the rest of the station's personnel?  
              - V'Thena does not want to speculate without additional information. All
              she knows is that there are pockets of survivors throughout the crippled
              station.
          - What happened?  
              - An unknown group of Andorians attempted to take the station, but failing
              that resorted to attempting to destroy it. They have been repelled, but
              the damage is extensive. Most strangely, the Andorian attackers were not
              wearing typical Imperial Guard uniforms.
          - What happened moments earlier?
              - A half dozen Andorian soldiers attempted to take the principal scientists
              hostage, but was repelled thanks to the players' assistance. Their bodies
              were searched and revealed they must have been from a splinter faction,
              though an incredibly organized one.
          - What is the station's current status?
              - Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
              crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
              sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.
          - Where is the *Endeavour*?  
              - Currently chasing down the unknown Andorian vessels that attacked the
              station.
          - Why are the Andorians attacking?
              - No idea, the laboratory isn't remotely worth a shooting war with the
              High Command and the Empire.
          - Why isn't the Coalition stopping them?
              - What Coalition. If you're referring to the Treaty of Galorndorn Core,
              everyone knows that the recent alliance between the High Command and
              the Romulan Star Empire has put the Andorians on edge, but this is an
              entirely illogical target.
          - What is the history between Starfleet and the Vulcans/Romulans?  
              - Earth was a Vulcan protectorate until the Vulcan-Romulus treaty two
              years ago, whch elevated it to an independent stellar nation in gratitude
              for normalizing relations between the two empires.
          - What have the scientists been working on?
              - That information is beyond the Subcommander's clearance.

              
          Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with a
          stern disapproval of humans asking illogical questions.


      As T'Var stated, the group quickly reaches a sealed airlock, which will require
      a **Fitness + Security** Task with a Difficulty of 3 to open. Alternatively, a
      **Control + Engineering** Task with the same difficulty can be attempted to
      jury-rig the airlock mechanism. Either task may Succeed at a Cost, which will
      take significantly more time and result in the security system's power being
      restored before the group can access the air-gap.


      The air-gap, as the name implies, is a pair of concenctric spheres with an
      evacuated gap in between. The only things connecting the inner shell to the
      outer one are a series of massive docking clamps, which engaged automatically
      when the station lost power. Normally the core is entirely disconnected from
      the rest of the station, and held in place with highly calibrated tractor
      beams.


      Travel between the two sides is limited to a pair of free-floating pods that
      ride along their own tractor beams, but the damage to the station knocked them
      loose from the moorings. They are currently free-floating within the gap.


      At some point during the traversal (or as the airlock is being opened if the
      players took too long), one of the other groups of survivors restores power to
      this section of the station, not knowing there was anyone inside. The security
      system activates, and a group of fixed phaser turrets begin to take aim at the
      group. With internal sensors down and the station ostensibly under attack, the
      security system has mistaken the group for saboteurs.

      ??? quote "Colonel Winchester's Log: August 2161"

          The *Endeavour* is responding to an automated distress signal from the
          Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory on the Andorian Badlands
          border. With the Self-Defense Forces fleet still recovering from the recent
          Klingon incursions, EarthDome has ordered us to lend whatever assistance
          the laboratory requires until an Andorian aid vessel can be dispatched. I
          have alerted sickbay to prepare to receive casualties, and our Chief
          Engineer is prepared to direct damage control teams should the station's
          structural integrity be compromised. Without any further information from
          the Laboratory personnel, we must be prepared for any contingency.


          Long range sensors have picked up strange energy readings emanating from
          the station, though the main computer has so far failed to match the
          readings to any known source, natural or otherwise. My Science Officer
          could not assure me that the readings do not pose a threat to the
          *Endeavour*, but I have decided to press on ahead at maximum warp. With the
          recent rumblings along the Klingon border, EarthDome could use all the
          goodwill we can get. We're only minutes away from the station, should my
          decision prove unwise this will be my last log entry. Due to the unknown
          nature of the disaster that has struck the station, I have asked that all
          potential away team members be inoculated against a wide range of
          radiological hazards, starting with my senior officers. Doctor Bauer is
          performing the injections now.

          update our records and jettison the ship's log buoy.



      ??? info "What the Endeavour's Log Shows"

          - Where are we?  
              - Andorian Free State Sh'othethal Stellar Laboratory
          - Why are we here?  
              - The *Endeavour* is responding to a distress signal from the
              Laboratory.
          - Has there been communication with the station?
              - No. Only the automated distress signal.
          - What happened earlier?
              - EarthDome issued orders to the *Endeavour* to immediately detour
              from it's patrol route and render assistance.
          - What is the station's current status?
              - Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
              crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
              sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.
          - Where are the attackers?  
              - Unknown, it's possible they got what they wanted and left, or they
              could be hiding nearby, ready to spring a trap. Early sensor readings
              indicate the weapons were Vulcan.
          - Why are the Vulcans attacking?
              - Tensions between warring Vulcan factions and their former subjugate
              nations are at an all-time high. After the implosion of the Vulcan government
              and the subsequent breakup of their hegemony five years ago, some factions
              are trying to carve out a piece of the carcass for themselves. Presumably
              some new faction has sprung up and decided to attack a soft target.
          - Why is the *Endeavour* helping?
              - EarthDome considers improving relations with the Andorian Free State
              of paramount importance to planetary security.
          - What is the history between EarthGov and the Vulcans/Andorians?  
              - As a minor, mostly autonomous protectorate not deemed particularly
              important, EarthGov weathered the collapse of the hegemony with only
              minor changes, but is in desperate need of allies against an upstart race,
              known as the Klingons, that were previously kept in check by the Vulcans.
          - What have the station been working on?
              - That information is not available.

              
          Other, more detailed questions will simply return a warning that EarthGov
          resources are not to be utilized for personal projects.



      A scan of the station requires a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by the
      ship's **Sensors + Science** with a Difficulty of 1, and a complication range
      of 19-20 due to the strange emanations coming from the station. The basic scan
      reveals that there are a number of life-forms aboard, though the number
      fluctuates wildly, varying anywhere from 12 to over 900. Additionally, the
      station appears to be in a low-power mode, and the disaster beacon has been
      activated.


      A **Control + Engineering** Task with a Difficulty 1 will reveal that most of
      the station's power has been diverted to the core, from where the strange
      radiance appears to emanate. It is not clear what is going on, and the sensor
      readings are too distorted to determine what exactly is happening. Momentum may
      be spent to determine the structural state of the station. It appears that all
      of the emergency bulkheads have been deployed. Additional Momentum reveals that
      the damage to the station appears to have been internally caused, possibly due
      to power surges prior to the station's reactors going into standby modes.


      The space surrounding the station is filled with spatial distortions. Should
      the *Endeavour* strike an anomaly, the ship experiences a sudden power failure
      that removes 2 Power from the ship. The GameMaster may spend Threat to remove
      additional power, at a cost of 1 Threat for every 2 Power removed. The players
      may attempt a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by the ship's **Sensors +
      Science** with a Difficulty of 2 to detect the spatial anomalies. Once
      detected, the anomalies can be *Charted* using a **Reason + Conn** Task
      assisted by the ship's **Sensors + Conn** with a Difficulty of 3. A successful
      Task reduces the difficulty of any Task to avoid the anomalies by 2. Otherwise
      the difficulty of maneuvering through the anomalies is a Difficulty 3 **Daring
      + Conn** Task assisted by the ship's **Engines + Conn**.


      A closer study of the anomalies with a **Reason + Science** Task assisted by
      the ship's **Sensors + Science** with a Difficulty of 2 reveals important
      information about the periodic instability of the anomalies. A successful task
      reduces the complication range of Tasks related to reversing the effects of the
      experiment by 2.


      Should the players attempt to dissuade the Captain from proceeding towards the
      station, they will be reminded that EarthGov owes the Andorian Free State a
      great deal after their assistance with securing the Klingon border. Starfleet
      has issued specific instructions that the *Endeavour* is to render any and all
      assistance to the Andorian peoples, and without definitive evidence of imminent
      danger to the ship it is the Captain's duty to carry out those orders.
      Regardless of any arguments made, the Captain will not abandon his duty and
      will order the helm to close with the station so that DCC teams can be
      dispatched aboard shuttlepods.


      Once the *Endeavour* has made it to the station, or become crippled by the
      anomalies, the players feel a lurch in their stomachs yet again.

      The players find themselves in a barricaded corridor deep within the station,
      surrounded by four armed Romulans. The players might at first mistake them for
      Vulcans, but the shiny golden helmets and semi-metallic sheen of the chequered
      military uniforms is distinctly non-Vulcan. Surprisingly, these Romulans do not
      appear to be in any way shape or form alarmed about the crew's presence, though
      they are clearly on edge, with many holding disruptors at the ready. The team's
      communicators are only capable of local communications, as ship-to-ship
      communications are being jammed.

      Looking around, it appears that the players and their Romulan companions are
      standing guard outside of a heavily secured room. The decor of the station is
      distinctly non-Vulcan as well. All of the wall markings and control surfaces
      are written in an unknown script. An **Insight + Command** Task with a
      Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the writing is indeed Romulan, as the players
      remember a Starfleet briefing on xenolinguistics for operations near the
      Romulan border. Alternatively, any player familiar with the Romulan language
      will be able to tell with a Difficulty of 0. Vulcan players may attempt the
      Task with a Difficulty of 1, as they would more likely recognize the script as
      an offshoot of ancient Vulcan.

      One of the Romulan officers, Centurion Lithena, noticing the obvious discomfort
      of the Starfleet personnel will approach the players to ask if anything is
      wrong. If questioned about what is happening, the Centurion will at first
      believe the questions to be in jest, but will answer the questions thinking
      them to be a human peculiarity.


      A closer inspection of their faces reveals that she looks almost identical to
      Subcommander V'Thena and one of the Romulan guards, Enuhlan Vrolmut, resembles
      Subaltern Skutt. Unlike their Vulcan doppelgangers, these Romulans are charismatic
      and jovial, and seem quite friendly.


      This scene should roughly match the information gathered during the descent to
      the laboratory core. An unknown group of combatants appeared out of nowhere,
      attacked without warning or cause, and left a swath of destruction before being
      defeated, only to have a new mystery as the attackers' faction does not match
      any known entity. This time however, it is Klingons who have crossed over and
      attacked the station, which is especially troubling for the natives of this reality
      as the Klingons have never been this ferocious, they tend to prefer a good deal of
      subterfuge and covert ops.
      

      ??? info "What the Centurion Knows"

          - Where are we?  
              - Romulan Federal Republic Sethika Stellar Laboratory  
          - Why are we here?  
              - The laboratory came under sudden attack by unknown Klingon forces.
              Since Starfleet and the Republic have a mutual defense treaty, the
              *Endeavour* responded to the distress signal while a relief fleet can
              be dispatched.
          - Why are we in this hallway?
              - The research team is hiding inside the emergency shelter while the
              Klingon boarding party is dealt with.  
          - Where is the rest of the station's personnel?  
              - Dead, wounded, missing, who knows? Lithena barely got the principal
              scientists evacuated into the shelter before everything went to hell.  
          - What happened earlier?  
              - A Klingon vessel decloaked and opened fire, allowing a troop transport
              to land troops on the station. Most of the attackers have been dispatched,
              but the defenders are scattered and uncoordinated.
          - What happened moments earlier?
              - The scientists were 'escorted' into the shelter and defensive positions
              were setup.
          - What is the station's current status?
              - Badly damaged and facing severe structural damage. Most of the
              crew is probably dead or trapped in disjoint pockets. With internal
              sensors and communications down, it's impossible to tell.
          - Where is the *Endeavour*?  
              - Currently chasing down the Klingon troop transport to prevent the
              assault team from being retrieved.
          - Why are the Klingons attacking?
              - Unclear, the Klingons have never been particularly aggressive, this
              must be some kind of violent splinter group looking to make a quick buck.
          - Where are the Vulcans?
              - Presumably dead, they split off thousands of years ago and have
              basically become little more than a legend. It is surprising that
              Starfleet personnel are so well versed in Romulan history.
          - How long have the Republic and Starfleet been allied?  
              - Officially, 2 years, ever since the *Enterprise* came to the Republic's
              aid against Klingon expansionism. Realistically, well over 100 years given
              the Romulans were the first species Humanity made contact with.
          - How many Klingons do we expect?
              - No more than 6. Hand scanners are short ranged, but that seems to be
              all that survived in this section of the station.
          - What have the scientists been working on?
              - No idea, you'll have to ask them once this is all over.

              
          Other, more detailed questions will be answered vaguely, often with some
          quip about history not being the forte of a career soldier.


      None of the other Romulans are particularly talkative, as they expect the
      Klingon assault to occur any moment. Indeed, the players may only get a few
      questions answered before the lights and sounds of 6 Klingon soldiers
      approach. The Romulans will voice their confusion at the strange attire
      and odd choice of weapons, which to the players should seem typically
      Klingon.

      Should the players fail to hold the corridor, Centurion Lithena, or any of the
      surviving Romulans, will indicate a ventilation shaft that the players may
      attempt to escape through. Alternatively, the players may end up getting
      captured, along with the sheltered scientists, and will only be able to get a
      handful of questions while the Klingons interrogate the scientists one by one.


      If the players successfully hold the corridor, the Klingon force is repelled
      and/or taken into custody by the Romulans. As before, the insignia and equipment
      doesn't appear to be recognized by the Romulans, who have never heard of the
      Klingon Empire. They're familiar with the Klingon Consortium, but this could
      represent a drastic shift in culture, or some long-lost warrior splinter faction.


      As the emergency shelter is open, the scientists can be probed for additional
      information about their experiments. One scientist in particular, Tolvar,
      insists that he must get back to the laboratory core, as the station and
      everyone in it are in grave danger.

      ??? info "Tolvar's Worries"

          Tolvar will speak to anyone who will listen. He has been poring through
          the experimental data while sheltering, and has come to the conclusion that
          the station's latest experiment may be breaking down the walls between
          realities.


          Most of the other scientists dispute his claims, but Tolvar is adamant that
          the data doesn't lie. The players can attempt a  **Reason + Science** Task
          with a Difficulty of 4 to follow Tolvar's logic. If the Task is failed or
          not attempted, Tolvar will spend additional time explaining the data,
          reducing the time available for additional questions. In any
          event, the players and scientists will be convinced of the veracity of
          Tolvar's analysis.


          If the players successfully follow Tolvar's explanation, they will gain an
          important insight into the experiment still underway deep within the
          station's core, which will reduce the difficulty of all Tasks associated
          with reversing the experiment's effects by 2. If the players run out of
          time, the explanation given by Tolvar will at least enable them to perform
          the Tasks.


          If the players reveal that they are from an alternate reality, they will
          discover that Tolvar is one of the only characters that will take them
          seriously. He will excitedly ask about the players' reality, but won't get
          too far in his questioning before Lithena interrupts.


      A status report by Centurion Lithena reveals that the station has suffered
      pretty severe structural damage, and the experimental chamber is too hazardous
      to approach. With the majority of the station's engineering crew dead, it will
      be up to the players to clear a path to the station's core.


      In any event, the players will eventually feel the now-familiar lurching
      sensation before the scientists can return to the experimental chamber.

    Title: Unknown Abandoned Space Station
    Subtitle: Scene 4 (T + 7 Hours)
    Text: >-
      The players are inside the central core of the station, still in EV suits
      though there are emergency lights available. The artificial gravity is weak but
      functional.

      
      Unlike other realities, the players are utterly alone in this iteration. It
      appears that the station's crew has been killed recently. The corpses of
      various species can be found strewn around, apparently suffocated as the
      station's life support failed. A mixed complement of Vulcanoids and Andorians
      can be found, but their insignia are not recognized. An **Insight + Medicine**
      Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that the Vulcanoids fall somewhere
      between a Vulcan and a Romulan. A Momentum spend further reveals that the
      two races must have recombined at some point in the past 700 years.


      Communications with the *Endeavour* are not available, as the core is heavily
      shielded against interference. A review of the station's log shows that most
      entries are irreversibly encrypted, and the controls have all been locked out.


      The experiment involves a massive particle accelerator, which must be properly
      quenched to prevent an explosion that could destroy the station. This is a
      Gated Challenge that requires multiple characters to perform a set of actions.
      If the group succeeded in following Tolvar's explanation, the Difficulty of these
      Tasks is reduced by 2. Similarly, if the players previously gathered detailed
      information about the anomalies, the complication range of these checks is
      reduced by two.

      A complication in an earlier task affects the next in sequence, increasing
      the Difficulty of that Task by 1 for each complication incurred.


      All of the tasks can Succeed at a Cost, though the mounting complications
      mean that the station's systems suffer damage in the process. If the final
      *Quench* operation is not successful, the experiment still shuts down, but
      a power overload in the station's reactors quickly builds. The effect is
      irreversible, and the station will be destroyed. Regardless of the outcome,
      just as the final exotic particles are annihilated, a surge of radiation
      kicks the players forward in time.

      The players find themselves aboard the bridge of the *Endeavour*. Depending
      on the outcome of the previous scene, the atmosphere can be drastically

      If the players successfully reverse the effects of the experiment, they find
      the bridge filled with members of the Vulcan science and security teams that
      survived and are helping the *Endeavour* crew supervise further rescue and
      repair operations.


      The tactical officer will note that a fleet of Andorian ships has arrived. They
      hail the *Endeavour*, and offer their assistance with the rescue effort.
      Despite the decades of animosity between the two nations, the Andorians seem
      earnest in their offer. The ranking Vulcan officer graciously accepts the
      Andorians' help, and makes a point of stating that such a scenario would have
      been unthinkable without humanity's intervention to create the Coalition.

    Subtitle: Laboratory Destroyed

      If the attempt at halting the experiment resulted in failure, the station's
      reactors are on the verge of detonation. The bridge is clear, save for perhaps
      one or two scientists that survived the ordeal, including Doctor Stolvar.
      They lament the loss of the station, and watch stoicly as the station's
      reactors explode, tearing the station apart.


      Long range sensors pick up an Andorian fleet just as it opens a hail. The
      Andorian commander expresses regret that the Vulcans did not heed their
      repeated warnings to increase security measures throughout the sector. He
      adds that the Andorian delegation to the Coalition will be presenting this
      incident as evidence that the Vulcan High Council is woefully unprepared to
      take over the running of the Vulcan government. Regardless, he offers to
      assist in the salvage efforts in hopes that at least some of the station's
      personnel can have an honorable burial.

    Subtitle: In Either Event

      A review of the ship's database reveals that everything is as it should be. The
      player's actions across the various leaked realities appear to have been
      mirrored here, though rather than fighting a Klingon or Andorian complement it
      was a group of Orion pirates hoping to make off with secret military
      technology.

      
      Should the players decide to reveal the particulars of their experience hopping
      between realities, one of the nearby Vulcan scientists, Doctor Stolvar, will
      engage in conversation. The scientist admits that there was data that could not
      be directly explained, but the Vulcan Science Directorate has determined that
      any kind of travel between alternative realities is impossible. A **Reason +
      Medicine** Task with a Difficulty of 2 will reveal that it was the doctor's
      inoculation, coupled with a fresh exposure to the strange radiation from the
      still-running experiment caused the players to experience these 'reality
      shifts'. Doctor Stolvar however suggests that it is more likely that the away
      team simply suffered hallucinations as a result of the exposure.
