  Description: >-
    Starfleet has intercepted a Romulan distress call from the Epsilon Legato system.
    A Bird-of-Prey encountered engine trouble and was forced to land on a Class-Y
    planet. With time ticking as the ship's hull is slowly eaten away by the corrosive
    atmosphere, the crew is ordered to retrieve as much information from the Romulan
    vessel as possible. Unbeknownst to the crew, a Romulan vessel has received the
    distress call too, and is itself underway to Epsilon Legato.

          Starfleet Command has intercepted a Romulan distress call from the disputed
          border system of Epsilon Legato. A Bird-of-Prey has been forced to make an
          unscheduled landing on a Demon-Class planet, making it unlikely that any
          of the crew survived. While tragic, this could be Starfleet's only chance
          to retrieve information from a Romulan vessel; information that could
          prove vital to the defense of Earth and its colonies.


          The *Endeavour* has been dispatched to investigate the wreckage and retrieve
          as much information from its computer core as possible. We estimate that
          at best a Romulan salvage and relief vessel is no less than 12 hours away,
          giving us a safe window of opportunity to search the vessel and depart
          without getting dragged into a firefight.

    Subtitle: Arrival in Epsilon Legato
    Text: >-
      Even a standard orbit around a Demon-class planet can be hazardous to an
      unprepared starship. Electromagnetic discharges can wreak havoc with various
      systems, especially sensors, which could cause navigational errors that
      destabilize the orbit of the vessel.


      Further complicating things, the magnetosphere of the planet appears to be
      rapidly rotating at about 2 Hz, like a magnetar, which renders shipborne
      weapons useless in orbit around the planet as the interference causes
      torpedoes to fail to track and energy weapons to rapidly dissipate.

      !!! quote "There's lifesigns!"

          It looks like the vessel's central compartments, like engineering and
          the bridge, have not been breached by the planet's atmosphere. Hold on,
          I'm picking up Romulan lifesigns. Ten, maybe twelve. They're weak, but
          they're alive!


      The Romulan vessel, the *IRW Destrix*, crash landed in the middle of a boiling
      corrosive lake on Epsilon Legato II. While the ship's hull is highly resistant
      to most substances, the highly corrosive mixture has already begun eating
      through the ship's hull. Based on long-range sensor telemetry, the mixture
      could eat through a standard Starfleet exosuit in less than 15 minutes.


      Short-range scans of the vessel should indicate that a portion of the Romulan
      crew has survived, trapped within sealed chambers within the vessel. It is
      not possible to beam out the Romulans. Unless the crew can somehow convince
      highly skeptical Romulans to surrender and willingly board a shuttlepod,
      the survivors will suffocate within hours.

      A Romulan rescue vessel will arrive as predicted by Starfleet's estimates.
      Their signal can be intercepted and decoded by the player's ship, but due
      to the planet's interference, won't be received by the *Destrix*. The rescue
      vessel's arrival marks the latest possible departure point for the crew,
      as Starfleet is not interested in risking one of its top vessels over a
      salvage dispute.

      Given the choice between a slow and painful death versus surrender to
      Starfleet, the Romulans are at a loss for what to do if their compatriots don't
      come to their rescue. Some may become desperate enough to agree to surrender,
      despite the fact it would mean never seeing their homes and families again. It
      could even lead to a mutiny onboard the wrecked ship.

    Subtitle: A Moral Quandry
    Text: >-
      A Romulan relief vessel is underway, but the EM interference makes it
      impossible for the subspace communications to reach the *Destrix*. The players'
      ship however was able to receive and decode the transmission, and could pass
      the message along to the Romulan survivors. Doing so however takes away the
      single biggest bargaining chip in the player's arsenal: desperation. With
      the knowledge that Romulan help is on the way, the *Destrix* survivors will
      refuse to cooperate further.

      The ranking Romulan survivor, Tevauna is the *Destrix*'s Executive Officer.
      She is loyal to the Romulan State, and will oppose any attempts to cooperate
      with the players, *unless* she can be convinced that the situation is hopeless
      and her remaining duty must be to her crew.

      A junior engineer's mate, Chomon lacks the hardliner stance of his superior
      officers. He does not wish to die, and will gratefully accept any assistance
      from the players, even at the risk of being made an example of by panicking
      officers.

    Title: Conclusion
    Text: >-
      There are multiple ways the scenario can end.


      It's possible that the players will fail to convince the Romulan crew to
      surrender, and choose to kill the Romulans by breaching the hull. This
      action will be detectable by the Romulan survey vessel, which will lead
      to accusations of war crimes that will hurt UE politically, and will lead
      to disciplinary action for the crew.


      The players may instead convince the Romulans to surrender by withholding
      information about the Romulan rescue vessel. They may choose to then either
      take the Romulans home as prisoners-of-war, or leave the Romulans behind
      in escape pods and shuttlepods to be rescued.


      Alternatively, the players might be able to stay on the moral true-and-narrow,
      and leave empty-handed but with clean consciences, maybe leaving supplies for
      the stranded Romulan crew to have a better chance of survival until rescue
      arrives. Could such a self-less action open the door to negotiations with
      the Romulans?
